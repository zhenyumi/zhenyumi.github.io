<h2 id="The-major-events-in-cell-cycle"><a href="#The-major-events-in-cell-cycle" class="headerlink" title="The major events in cell cycle"></a>The major events in cell cycle</h2><p>There are several basic steps in cell division:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cell growth</li>
<li>Cells often but not always attain certain size to begin division. </li>
<li>Accumulate enough material to support 2 cells.</li>
<li>Duplication of chromosomes</li>
<li>Cells need full and accurate complement of DNA. </li>
<li>Repair damage and copy DNA.</li>
<li>Chromosome segregation</li>
<li>Ensure that both daughter cells receive full set of chromosomes.</li>
<li>Cytokinesis</li>
<li>Separating 2 cells.</li>
<li>Pinching and closing plasma membrane.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chromosome duplication</strong> occurs during <strong>S phase</strong> (S for DNA <u>synthesis</u>), which requires <u>10–12 hours</u> and occupies about half of the cell-cycle time in a typical mammalian cell. </p>
<p>After S phase, chromosome segregation and cell division occur in <strong>M phase</strong> (M  for mitosis), which requires much less time (less than an hour in a mammalian cell). M phase comprises two major events: nuclear division, or mitosis, during which the copied chromosomes are distributed into a pair of daughter nuclei;  and cytoplasmic division, or <strong>cytokinesis</strong>, when the cell itself divides in two</p>
<p>At the end of S phase, the DNA molecules in each pair of duplicated chromosomes are intertwined and held tightly together by <u>specialized protein linkages.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Early in mitosis at a stage called prophase, the two DNA molecules are gradually disentangled and condensed into pairs of <u>rigid, compact rods</u> called <strong>sister chromatids</strong>, which remain linked by sister-chromatid <font color="EE0000">cohesion</font></p>
<p>When the nuclear envelope disassembles later in mitosis, the sister-chromatid pairs become attached to the <strong>mitotic spindle</strong>, a giant bipolar array of microtubules (discussed  in Chapter 16). Sister chromatids are attached to opposite poles of the spindle and, eventually, align at the spindle equator in a stage called <strong>metaphase</strong>.</p>
<p>The destruction of sister-chromatid <strong>cohesion</strong> at the start of anaphase separates the sister chromatids, which are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle. The spindle is then disassembled, and the segregated chromosomes are packaged into separate nuclei at <strong>telophase</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cytokinesis then cleaves the cell in two, so that each daughter cell inherits one of the two nuclei</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle Usually Consists of Four Phases</p>
<p>Partly to allow time for growth, most cell cycles have <strong>gap phases</strong>—a <strong>G<del>1</del> phase</strong> between M phase and S phase and a <strong>G<del>2</del> phase</strong> between S phase and mitosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>G1, S, G2, and M.  </li>
<li>G1, S, and G2 together are called <strong>interphase</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cell growth occurs throughout the cell cycle, <u>except during mitosis.</u></p>
<p>The two gap phases are more than simple time delays to allow cell growth. They also provide time for the cell to <u>monitor the internal and external environment</u> to ensure that conditions are suitable and preparations are complete before the cell commits itself to the major upheavals of S phase and mitosis</p>
<p>The G1 phase is especially important in this respect. Its length can <u>vary greatly</u> depending on <u>external conditions and extracellular signals</u> from other cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>If extracellular conditions are unfavorable, for example, cells delay progress through G1 and may even enter a specialized resting state known as <strong>G<del>0</del> (G zero)</strong>, in which they can remain for days, weeks, or even years before resuming proliferation. Indeed, many cells  remain permanently in G<del>0</del> until they or the organism dies.</li>
</ul>
<p>If extracellular conditions are <u>favorable</u> and signals to grow and divide are present, cells in early G<del>1</del> or G<del>0</del> progress through a commitment point near the end of G<del>1</del> known as <strong>Start</strong> (in yeasts) or the <strong>restriction point</strong> (in mammalian cells)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cell-Cycle Control Is Similar in All Eukaryotes</p>
<p>Some features of the cell cycle, including the time required to complete certain events, vary greatly from one cell type to another, even in the same organism</p>
<ul>
<li>All eukaryotes appear to use similar machinery and control mechanisms to drive and regulate cell-cycle events</li>
</ul>

<p>The Cell-Cycle Control System Triggers the Major Events of the Cell Cycle</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>cell-cycle control system</strong> operates much like a <strong>timer</strong> that triggers the events of the cell cycle in a set sequence</li>
<li>In most cells, however, the control system does respond to information received back from the processes it controls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cell-cycle control system is based on a connected series of <strong>biochemical switches</strong>, each of which initiates a specific cell-cycle event.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, the switches are generally <strong>binary</strong> (on&#x2F;off)  and launch events in a complete, <u>irreversible</u> fashion. It would clearly be disastrous</li>
<li>Second, the cell-cycle control system is remarkably <strong>robust and reliable</strong>, partly because backup mechanisms and other features allow the system to operate effectively under a variety of conditions and even if some components fail</li>
<li>Finally, the control system is <strong>highly adaptable</strong> and <strong>can be modified</strong> to suit specific cell types or to respond to specific intracellular or extracellular signals.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cyclins</strong> and <strong>cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks)</strong> drive cell cycle events</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most eukaryotic cells, the cell-cycle control system governs cell-cycle progression at <u>three major regulatory transitions</u></p>
<ol>
<li>The first is <strong>Start</strong>  (or the <strong>restriction point)</strong> in <strong>late G1</strong>, where the cell commits to cell-cycle entry and <u>chromosome duplication</u></li>
<li>The second is the <strong>G2&#x2F;M transition</strong>, where the control system <u>triggers the early mitotic events</u> that lead to chromosome alignment on  the mitotic spindle in metaphase.</li>
<li>The third is the <strong>metaphase-to-anaphase transition</strong>, where the control system <u>stimulates sister-chromatid separation</u>, leading to the <u>completion of mitosis and cytokinesis.</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The control system blocks progression through each of these transitions if it <u>detects problems inside or outside the cell</u>. If the control system senses problems in the completion of DNA replication, for example, it will hold the cell at the G2&#x2F;M transition <u>until those problems are  solved</u>. Similarly, if extracellular conditions are not appropriate for cell proliferation, the control system blocks progression through Start, thereby <u>preventing cell division until conditions become favorable</u></p>

<p>The Cell-Cycle Control System Depends on Cyclically Activated Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinases (Cdks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Central components of the cell-cycle control system are members of a family of <strong>protein kinases</strong> known as <strong>cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An <u>increase</u> in Cdk activity at the G2&#x2F;M transition, for example, increases the phosphorylation of proteins that control chromosome condensation, nuclear-envelope breakdown, spindle assembly, and other events that occur in early mitosis.</p>
<p>Cyclical changes in Cdk activity are controlled by <u>a complex array of enzymes and other proteins</u>. The most important of these Cdk regulators are proteins known as <strong>cyclins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cdks, as their name implies, are dependent on cyclins for their activity: unless they are bound tightly to a cyclin, they have no protein kinase activity (Figure 17–10).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks): Ser&#x2F;Thr kinases</p>

<ul>
<li>When cyclin forms a complex with Cdk, the protein kinase is activated to trigger specific cell-cycle events. <ul>
<li>Without cyclin, Cdk is inactive.</li>
<li>Cyclin decides cdk substrates specificity and activates Cdk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different cyclins oscillate in cell cycle and bind to or control the activity of different Cdks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four classes of cyclins, each defined by the stage of the cell cycle atwhich they bind Cdks and function. <u>All eukaryotic cells require <strong>three</strong> of these classes</u></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>G1&#x2F;S-cyclins</strong> activate Cdks in late G1 and thereby help trigger progression through Start, resulting in a commitment to <u>cell-cycle entry</u>. <u>Their levels fall in S phase.</u></li>
<li><strong>S-cyclins</strong> bind Cdks <u>soon after progression through Start</u> and help stimulate <strong>chromosome duplication</strong>. <u>S-cyclin levels remain elevated until mitosis</u>, and these cyclins also contribute to the control of <strong>some early mitotic events</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>M-cyclins</strong> activate Cdks that stimulate <u>entry into mitosis at the G2&#x2F;M transition</u>. M-cyclin levels <u>fall in mid-mitosis</u></li>
</ol>
<p>In most cells, a fourth class of cyclins, the <strong>G1-cyclins</strong>, helps <u>govern the activities of the G1&#x2F;S-cyclins</u>, which control progression <u>through Start in late G1.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>yeast cells,</strong> a <strong>single Cdk</strong> protein binds all classes of cyclins and triggers different cell-cycle events by <u>changing cyclin partners at different stages of the cycle.</u>  </li>
<li>In <strong>vertebrate cells</strong>, by contrast, there are <strong>four Cdks.</strong> <u>Two interact with G1-cyclins</u>, one with G1&#x2F;Sand S-cyclins, and one with S- and M-cyclins</li>
</ul>
<p>the cyclin protein does not simply activate its Cdk partner but also <u>directs it</u> to <strong>specific target proteins</strong>. As a result,  each cyclin–Cdk complex <strong>phosphorylates</strong> a different set of substrate proteins.</p>
<ul>
<li>The same cyclin–Cdk complex can also <u>induce different effects at different times</u> in the cycle, probably because the <strong>accessibility</strong> of some <strong>Cdk substrates</strong> changes during the cell cycle.</li>

</ul>
<p>The key regulator of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is the <strong>anaphase-promoting complex</strong>, <strong>or cyclosome (APC&#x2F;C)</strong>, a member of the <strong>ubiquitin ligase</strong> family of enzymes</p>
<ul>
<li>They <strong>polyubiquitylate</strong> specific target proteins, resulting in their <u>destruction in proteasomes.</u></li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>APC&#x2F;C</strong> catalyzes the ubiquitylation and destruction of <u>two major types of proteins.</u> The first is <strong><font color="EE0000">securin</font></strong>, which protects the protein linkages that <u>hold sister-chromatid pairs together in early mitosis.</u></p>

<p>S-Cdk Initiates DNA Replication Once Per Cycle</p>
<p>DNA replication begins at <strong>origins of replication</strong>, which are scattered at numerous locations in every chromosome.</p>
<ul>
<li>During S phase, DNA replication is initiated at these origins when a DNA helicase unwinds the double helix and DNA replication enzymes are loaded onto the two single-stranded templates. This leads to the elongation phase of replication, when the replication machinery moves outward from the origin at two replication forks</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step occurs in <strong>late mitosis</strong> and <strong>early G1</strong>, when a pair of inactive DNA helicases is loaded onto the <strong>replication origin</strong>, forming a large complex called the <strong>prereplicative complex</strong> or <strong><font color="EE0000">preRC</font></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This step is sometimes called <u>licensing</u> of replication origins because initiation of DNA synthesis is permitted only at <u>origins containing a <strong>preRC</strong></u>. </li>
<li>The second step occurs in <strong>S phase</strong>, when the <strong>DNA helicases</strong> are <u>activated</u>, resulting in DNA unwinding and the initiation of DNA synthesis</li>
<li>Once a replication origin has been fired in this way, the two helicases move out from the origin with the replication forks, and that <u>origin cannot be reused</u> until a new <strong>preRC</strong> is assembled there at the end of mitosis. As a result, origins can be activated only once per cell cycle.</li>

<p>S phase: DNA replication once and only once</p>
<p>Most important questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>How to ensure that DNA is replicated only once? </li>
<li>How to get the timing right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromosome duplication is a “two-step” procedure:<ul>
<li>1st : initiation&#x2F;priming of the DNA</li>
<li>2nd : start of the replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both processes are temporally separated and tightly controlled by Cdks and APC&#x2F;C: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <strong>late mitosis</strong> and <strong>early G1</strong>, the proteins <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdc6</font></strong> and <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdt1</font></strong> collaborate with the ORC to load the <u>inactive DNA helicases</u>  around the DNA <u>next to the origin</u>.

<p>At the <strong>onset of S phase</strong>, S-Cdk triggers origin activation by <u>phosphorylating specific initiator proteins</u>, which then nucleate the assembly of a large protein complex that activates the DNA helicase and recruits the DNA synthesis machinery</p>
<p>Another protein kinase called <strong><font color="EE0000">DDK</font></strong> is also activated in S phase and helps drive origin activation by phosphorylating specific subunits of the DNA helicase.</p>

<p>Chromosome Duplication Requires Duplication of Chromatin Structure</p>
<p>The <u>production</u> of <strong>chromatin proteins</strong> increases during <strong>S phase</strong> to provide the raw materials needed to package the newly synthesized DNA.</p>
<p>Most importantly,  <strong>S-Cdks</strong> stimulate a large increase in the synthesis of the <u>four histone subunits</u> that form the histone octamers at the core of each nucleosome.</p>
<p>These subunits are assembled into nucleosomes on the DNA by <strong>nucleosome assembly factors,</strong> which typically <strong>associate with the replication fork</strong> and distribute nucleosomes on both strands of the DNA as they emerge from the DNA synthesis machinery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chromatin packaging helps to control gene expression.</p>
<p>In some parts of the chromosome, the chromatin is highly condensed and is called <strong>heterochromatin</strong>, whereas in other regions it has a more open structure and is called <strong>euchromatin (常染色质)</strong></p>
<p>These differences in chromatin structure depend on a variety of mechanisms, including <strong>modification of histone tails</strong> and the <strong>presence of  non-histone proteins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During DNA synthesis, <strong>histone-modifying enzymes</strong> and various <strong>non-histone proteins</strong> are probably <u>deposited</u> onto the two <strong>new DNA strands</strong> as they emerge from the replication fork, and these proteins are thought to <u>reproduce the local chromatin structure of the parent chromosome</u></li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From a regulatory point of view, mitosis can be divided into two major parts, each governed by distinct components of the cell-cycle control system</p>
<ol>
<li>First, an <u>abrupt increase in M-Cdk activity</u> at the <strong>G2&#x2F;M transition</strong> triggers the events of early mitosis (<strong>prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase</strong>). During this period,  M-Cdk and several other mitotic protein kinases <u>phosphorylate a variety of proteins,</u> leading to the <u>assembly of the mitotic spindle</u> and its <u>attachment to the sister-chromatid pairs</u></li>
<li>The second major part of mitosis begins <u>at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition,</u> when the <strong>APC&#x2F;C</strong> triggers the <u>destruction of <strong>securin</strong></u>, liberating a protease that cleaves <strong>cohesin</strong> and thereby <u>initiates separation</u> of the sister chromatids.<ul>
<li>The <strong>APC&#x2F;C</strong> also promotes the <strong>destruction of cyclins</strong>, which leads to <strong>Cdk inactivation</strong> and the <u>dephosphorylation of Cdk targets</u>, which is required for all events of late M phase, including the completion of anaphase, the disassembly of the mitotic spindle, and the division of the cell by cytokinesis</li>

<p>M-Cdk Drives Entry Into Mitosis</p>
<ol>
<li>At a minimum, M-Cdk must <u>induce the assembly of the mitotic spindle</u> and ensure that each sister chromatid in a pair is attached to the <u>opposite pole</u> of the spindle.</li>
<li>It also triggers <strong>chromosome condensation</strong>, the large-scale reorganization of the intertwined sister chromatids into compact, rodlike structures.

</ol>
<p>M-Cdk does not act alone to phosphorylate key proteins involved in early mitosis</p>
<ul>
<li>Two additional families of protein kinases, the <strong><font color="EE0000">Polo-like kinases</font></strong> and the <strong><font color="EE0000">Aurora kinases</font></strong>, also make important contributions to the control of early mitotic events.</li>
<li>The Polo-like kinase <strong><font color="EE0000">Plk</font></strong>, for example, is required for the normal assembly of a <strong>bipolar mitotic spindle</strong>, in part because it <u>phosphorylates proteins involved in separation of the spindle poles early in mitosis.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>The Aurora kinase <strong><font color="EE0000">Aurora-A</font></strong> also helps control proteins that govern the <u>assembly and stability</u> of the spindle,  whereas <strong><font color="EE0000">Aurora-B</font></strong> controls <u>attachment of sister chromatids to the spindle,</u></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dephosphorylation</strong> Activates M-Cdk at the Onset of Mitosis</p>

<li>M-Cdk activation begins with the accumulation of M-cyclin (<strong>cyclin B</strong> in vertebrate  cells)</li>
</ul>
<p>In embryonic cell cycles, the <u>synthesis</u> of M-cyclin is <u>constant</u> throughout the cell cycle, and M-cyclin accumulation results from the high  stability of the protein in interphase</p>
<p><strong>M-cyclin synthesis</strong> increases during <strong>G<del>2</del> and M</strong>, owing primarily to <u>an increase in M-cyclin gene transcription.</u> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the Cdk in these complexes is phosphorylated at an activating site by the <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdk-activating kinase (CAK)</font></strong>, as discussed earlier, the protein kinase <strong><font color="EE0000">Wee1</font></strong> holds it in an inactive state by inhibitory phosphorylation at two neighboring sites</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, by the time the cell reaches the end of G<del>2</del>, it contains an <strong>abundant</strong> stockpile of <strong>M-Cdk</strong> that is primed and ready to act but is  suppressed by phosphates that block the active site of the kinase</li>
</ul>
<p>What, then, triggers the activation of the M-Cdk stockpile? <strong>Cdc25</strong> can also be activated, at least in part, by its target, M-Cdk.  M-Cdk may also inhibit the inhibitory kinase Wee1.</p>
<ul>
<li>The crucial event is the activation of the protein phosphatase <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdc25</font></strong>, which <u>removes the inhibitory phosphates that restrain M-Cdk</u></li>
<li>At the same time, the inhibitory activity of the kinase <strong><font color="EE0000">Wee1</font></strong> is <u>suppressed,</u> further ensuring that M-Cdk activity increases.</li>

<p>The APC&#x2F;C Triggers Sister-Chromatid Separation and the Completion of Mitosis</p>
<p>Although M-Cdk activity sets the stage for this event, the <strong>anaphase-promoting complex (APC&#x2F;C)</strong> discussed earlier throws the switch that initiates sister-chromatid separation by ubiquitylating several <strong>mitotic regulatory proteins</strong> and thereby triggering their destruction</p>
<p>During metaphase, <strong>cohesins</strong> holding the sister chromatids together resist the poleward forces that pull the sister chromatids apart. <u>Anaphase begins with the sudden loss of sister-chromatid <strong>cohesion</strong></u>, which allows the sisters to separate and move to opposite poles of the spindle</p>
<ul>
<li>The APC&#x2F;C initiates the process by targeting the inhibitory protein <strong><font color="EE0000">securin</font></strong> for <strong>destruction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before anaphase, <strong>securin</strong> binds to and <strong>inhibits</strong> the activity of a protease called <strong><font color="EE0000">separase</font></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The destruction  of securin at the end of metaphase releases <strong>separase</strong>, which is then free to cleave  one of the subunits of <strong>cohesin</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to securin, the APC&#x2F;C also targets the <strong>S- and M-cyclins</strong> for destruction, leading to the <strong>loss</strong> of most Cdk <strong>activity</strong> in anaphase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cdk inactivation allows <strong>phosphatases</strong> to <strong>dephosphorylate</strong> the many Cdk target substrates in the cell, as required for the completion of mitosis and cytokinesis.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what activates the APC&#x2F;C? </p>
<p>APC&#x2F;C activation requires binding to the protein <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdc20</font></strong>, At least two processes regulate <strong>Cdc20</strong>  and its association with the <strong>APC&#x2F;C.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, <strong>Cdc20</strong> synthesis increases as the cell approaches mitosis, owing to an increase in the transcription of its gene.</li>
<li>Second, <strong>phosphorylation</strong> of the <strong>APC&#x2F;C</strong> helps <strong>Cdc20</strong> bind to the <strong>APC&#x2F;C</strong>, thereby helping to create an active complex. Among the kinases that phosphorylate and thus activate the APC&#x2F;C is <strong><font color="EE0000">M-Cdk</font></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, M-Cdk not only triggers the early mitotic events leading up to metaphase, but it also sets the stage for progression into anaphase. </p>
<p>The ability of <strong>M-Cdk</strong> to promote <strong>Cdc20–APC&#x2F;C</strong> activity creates a <strong>negative feedback</strong> loop: M-Cdk sets in motion a regulatory process that leads to cyclin destruction and thus its own inactivation.</p>

<p>Unattached Chromosomes Block Sister-Chromatid Separation: The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint</p>
<p>Drugs that destabilize microtubules, such as <strong>colchicine</strong> or <strong>vinblastine</strong> (discussed in Chapter 16), arrest cells in mitosis for hours or even days.</p>
<p>The checkpoint mechanism ensures that cells do not enter anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly <strong>bi-oriented</strong> on the mitotic spindle.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spindle assembly checkpoint depends on a <strong>sensor mechanism</strong> that monitors the <strong>strength</strong> of microtubule attachment at the kinetochore, possibly by sensing <strong>tension</strong> as described earlier</li>
<li>Any kinetochore that is not properly attached to the spindle sends out a <strong>diffusible negative signal</strong> that blocks <strong>Cdc20–APC&#x2F;C</strong> activation throughout the cell and thus <strong>blocks</strong> the metaphase-to-anaphase transition</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative checkpoint signal depends on several proteins, including <strong><font color="EE0000">Mad2</font></strong>, which are recruited to unattached kinetochores</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed structural analyses of <strong>Mad2</strong> suggest that the unattached kinetochore acts like an <strong>enzyme</strong> that catalyzes a change in the conformation of <strong>Mad2</strong>, so that <strong>Mad2</strong>,  together with other proteins, can bind and <u>inhibit</u> Cdc20–APC&#x2F;C.</li>
</ul>
<p>In mammalian somatic cells, the spindle assembly checkpoint determines the normal <u>timing</u> of anaphase</p>

<p>Segregated Chromosomes Are Packaged in Daughter Nuclei at Telophase</p>
<p>In <strong>telophase</strong>, the final stage of mitosis,  the two sets of chromosomes are packaged into a pair of <strong>daughter nuclei.</strong> The first  major event of telophase is the <u>disassembly of the mitotic spindle</u>, followed by  the <u>re-formation of the nuclear envelope</u>.</p>
<p>Nuclear pore complexes are incorporated into the envelope, the <strong>nuclear lamina</strong> re-forms, and the envelope once again becomes <u>continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum.</u></p>
<p>We saw earlier that <strong>phosphorylation</strong> of various proteins by <strong>M-Cdk</strong> promotes <u>spindle assembly</u>, <u>chromosome condensation</u>, and <u>nuclear-envelope breakdown</u>  in early mitosis. </p>
<ul>
<li>phosphorylation of various proteins by M-Cdk promotes spindle assembly, chromosome condensation, and nuclear-envelope breakdown in early mitosis.

<li>In <strong>budding yeast</strong>, for example, the completion of mitosis depends on the activation of a phosphatase called <strong><font color="EE0000">Cdc14</font></strong>, which dephosphorylates a subset of Cdk substrates involved in anaphase and telophase.</li>

<p>Actin-myosin filament rings assemble at the midpoint of a dividing cell</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actin and Myosin II in the Contractile Ring Generate the Force for Cytokinesis</p>
<p>In interphase cells, actin and myosin II filaments form a <strong>cortical network</strong> underlying the plasma membrane. In some cells, they also form large cytoplasmic bundles called <strong>stress fibers</strong></p>
<p>As cells enter mitosis, these arrays of actin and myosin disassemble; much of the <strong>actin reorganizes</strong>, and <strong>myosin II filaments</strong> are released.</p>
<p>As the sister chromatids separate in anaphase, actin and myosin II begin to accumulate in the rapidly assembling <strong>contractile ring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assembly of the contractile ring results in part from the local formation of new actin filaments, which depends on <strong><font color="EE0000">formin</font></strong> proteins that nucleate the assembly of parallel arrays of linear, unbranched actin filaments</li>
</ul>
<p>After anaphase, the overlapping arrays of actin and myosin II filaments contract to generate the force that divides the cytoplasm in two</p>
<ul>
<li>unlike actin in muscle, the actin filaments in the ring are highly <u>dynamic</u>, and their arrangement changes continually during cytokinesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The contractile ring is finally dispensed with altogether when cleavage ends, as the plasma membrane of the cleavage furrow narrows to form the <strong>midbody</strong>.</p>
<ul>

<p>How does the mitotic spindle specify the site of division? Three general mechanisms have been proposed:</p>

<li>A second possibility, called the central <strong>spindle stimulation model,</strong> is that the <strong>spindle midzone</strong>, or <strong>central spindle</strong>, generates a <strong>furrow-inducing signal</strong> that specifies the site of furrow formation at the <strong>cell cortex</strong> <ul>
<li>The overlapping <strong>interpolar microtubules</strong> of the central spindle associate with numerous <strong>signaling proteins</strong>, including proteins that may stimulate <strong>RhoA</strong></li>
