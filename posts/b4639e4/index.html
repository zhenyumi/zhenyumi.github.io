<p>During <strong>wakefulness</strong> the EEG of a normal person shows two basic patterns of activity: <strong>alpha activity</strong> and <strong>beta activity</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li><u>Alpha activity</u> consists of regular, <strong>medium-frequency waves of 8–12 Hz</strong>. The brain produces this activity when a person is <u>resting quietly,</u> not particularly aroused or excited and not engaged in strenuous mental activity (such as problem solving). Although alpha waves sometimes occur when a person’s eyes are open, they are much more prevalent when they are closed. </li>
<li><u>Beta activity</u> , consists of irregular, mostly <strong>low-amplitude waves of 13–30 Hz.</strong> Beta activity shows desynchrony; it reflects the fact that many different neural circuits in the brain are actively processing information. Desynchronized activity occurs when a person is <u>alert and attentive</u> to events in the environment or is thinking actively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Stage-1-Sleep"><a href="#2-Stage-1-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="2. Stage 1 Sleep"></a>2. Stage 1 Sleep</h3><p>The subject becomes drowsy and soon enters <strong>stage 1 sleep</strong>, marked by the presence of some theta activity (3.5–7.5 Hz), which indicates that the firing of neurons in the neocortex is becoming more synchronized. </p>
<p><u>This stage is actually a transition between sleep and wakefulness</u>; if we watch our volunteer’s eyelids, we will see that from time to time they slowly open and close and that her eyes roll upward and downward. </p>
<h3 id="3-Stage-2-Sleep"><a href="#3-Stage-2-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="3. Stage 2 Sleep"></a>3. Stage 2 Sleep</h3><img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Biopsychology/image-20201023114500377.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="image-20201023114500377" style="zoom:67%;" />

<p>About ten minutes later she enters <strong>stage 2 sleep</strong>. The EEG during this stage is generally irregular but contains periods of theta activity, <strong>sleep spindles,</strong> and K complexes. </p>
<p>Sleep spindles are short bursts of waves of 12–14 Hz that occur between two and five times a minute during stages 1–4 of sleep.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K complexes</strong> appear to play a role in the <u>consolidation of memories,</u> and increased numbers of sleep spindles are correlated with increased scores on tests of intelligence (Fogel and Smith, 2011). </li>
<li>They are sudden, sharp waveforms that, unlike sleep spindles, are usually found only during stage 2 sleep. They spontaneously occur at the rate of approximately one per minute but often can be triggered by noises—especially unexpected noises. </li>
<li>Cash et al. (2009) recorded the activity of single neurons in the human cerebral cortex during sleep and found that K complexes consisted of isolated periods of neural inhibition. (The recordings were made from the brains of patients who were being evaluated for neurosurgery.) K complexes appear to be the forerunner of delta waves, which appear in the deepest levels of sleep.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> The subject is sleeping soundly now; if awakened, however, she might report that she has not been asleep. This phenomenon often is reported by nurses who awaken loudly snoring hospital patients early in the night (probably to give them a sleeping pill) and find that the patients insist that they were lying there awake all the time. </p>

<p>About fifteen minutes later the subject enters <strong>stage 3 sleep</strong>, signaled by the occurrence of high-amplitude <strong>delta activity (slower than 3.5 Hz)</strong>. The distinction between stage 3 and stage 4 is not clear-cut; stage 3 contains 20–50 percent delta activity, and stage 4 contains more than 50 percent. Because slow-wave EEG activity predominates during sleep <strong>stages 3 and 4</strong>, they are collectively referred to as <u>slow-wave sleep .</u> </p>
<blockquote>
<p> In recent years, researchers have begun studying the details of the EEG activity that occurs during slow-wave sleep and the brain mechanisms responsible for this activity (Steriade, 2003, 2006). It turns out that the most important feature of slow-wave activity during sleep is the presence of slow oscillations of less than 1 Hz. Each oscillation consists of a single high-amplitude biphasic (down and up) wave of slightly less than 1 Hz. The first part of the wave indicates a down state—a period of inhibition during which neurons in the neocortex are absolutely silent. Presumably, it is during this down state that neocortical neurons are able to rest. The second part indicates an up state—a period of excitation during which these neurons briefly fire at a high rate. </p>
<p>By most criteria, stage 4 is the deepest stage of sleep.</p>

<p>About <strong>ninety minutes</strong> after the beginning of sleep (and about <strong>forty-five</strong> minutes after the onset of stage 4 sleep), we notice an abrupt change in a number of physiological measures recorded from our subject. </p>
<p>The EEG suddenly becomes mostly desynchronized, with a sprinkling of <strong>theta waves</strong>, very similar to the record obtained during stage 1 sleep. We also note that her eyes are rapidly <u>darting back and forth</u> beneath her closed eyelids. We can see this activity in the EOG (Electro-oculogram), recorded from electrodes attached to the skin around her eyes, or we can observe the eye movements directly—the cornea produces a bulge in the closed eyelids that can be seen to move about. We also see that the EMG becomes silent; there is a profound loss of muscle tone. In fact, physiological studies have shown that, aside from occasional twitching, a person actually becomes paralyzed during REM sleep. This peculiar stage of sleep is quite distinct from the quiet sleep we saw earlier. It is usually referred to as REM sleep (for the rapid eye movements that characterize it).</p>

Insomnia 失眠症"></a>1. Insomnia 失眠症</h3><p>Because we spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, sleep disorders can have a significant impact on our quality of life. <u>They can also affect the way we feel while we are awake.</u></p>
<p>Insomnia is a problem that is said to affect approximately 25 percent of the population occasionally and 9 percent regularly.</p>
<p>Insomnia is characterized as <u>difficulty falling asleep after going to bed</u> or <u>after awakening during the night</u>. But a significant problem in identifying insomnia is the unreliability of self-reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant problem in identifying insomnia is the unreliability of self-reports. Most patients who receive a prescription for a sleeping medication are given one on the basis of their own description of their symptoms. That is, they tell their physician that they sleep very little at night, and the drug is prescribed on the basis of this testimony. Very few patients are observed during a night’s sleep in a sleep laboratory; thus, <u>insomnia is one of the few medical problems that physicians treat without having direct clinical evidence for its existence</u>. But studies on the sleep of people who complain of insomnia show that most of them underestimate the amount of time they actually spend sleeping.</p>
<p>For many years the goal of sleeping medication was to help people fall asleep, and when drug companies evaluated potential medications, they concentrated on that property. However, if we think about the ultimate goal of sleeping medication, it is to make the person feel more refreshed the next day. If a medication puts people to sleep right away but produces a hangover of grogginess and difficulty concentrating the next day, it is worse than useless. In fact, many drugs that are traditionally used to treat insomnia had just this effect. <u>Researchers have now recognized that the true evaluation of a sleeping medication must be made during wakefulness the following day, and “hangover-free”</u> drugs are finally being developed (Hajak et al., 1995; Ramakrishnan and Scheid, 2007).</p>
<p>Many people spend much of their time in a sleep-deprived state not because they suffer from insomnia, but because the demands of their daily schedules lead them to stay up late or get up early (or both), thus receiving less than the optimal amount of sleep. <u>Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health problems,</u> including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Orzel-Gryglewska, 2010).</p>

<p>Patients with this disorder, called sleep apnea, fall asleep and then cease to breathe.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Apnos is Greek for “without breathing.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all people, especially people who snore（打鼾）, have occasional episodes of sleep apnea, but not to the extent that it interferes with sleep. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a period of sleep apnea the level of carbon dioxide in the blood stimulates chemoreceptors (neurons that detect the presence of certain chemicals), and the person wakes up, gasping for air. The oxygen level of the blood returns to normal, the person falls asleep, and the whole cycle begins again. Because sleep is disrupted, people with this disorder typically feel sleepy and groggy during the day. Fortunately, many cases of sleep apnea are caused by an obstruction of the airway that can be corrected surgically or relieved by a device that attaches to the sleeper’s face and provides pressurized air that keeps the airway open.</p>

<h3 id="3-Narcolepsy-猝睡症；嗜睡症"><a href="#3-Narcolepsy-猝睡症；嗜睡症" class="headerlink" title="3. Narcolepsy 猝睡症；嗜睡症"></a>3. Narcolepsy 猝睡症；嗜睡症</h3><h4 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>(narke means “numbness,” and lepsis means “seizure”) </p>
<p>It is a neurological disorder characterized by sleep (or some of its components) at inappropriate times. The symptoms can be described in terms of what we know about the phenomena of sleep. The primary symptom of narcolepsy is the <strong><u>sleep attack</u></strong>. The narcoleptic sleep attack is an overwhelming urge to sleep that can happen at any time but occurs most often under monotonous, boring conditions. Sleep (which appears to be entirely normal) generally lasts for 2–5 minutes. The person usually wakes up feeling refreshed.</p>
<p>Another symptom of narcolepsy—in fact, the most striking one—is <strong><u>cataplexy</u></strong> (from kata, “down,” and plexis, “stroke”). During a cataplectic attack a person will sustain varying amounts of <strong><u>muscle weakness</u></strong>. In some cases, the person will become completely paralyzed and slump down to the floor. The person will lie there, fully conscious, for a few seconds to several minutes. What apparently happens is that one of the phenomena of REM sleep—muscular paralysis—occurs at an inappropriate time. This loss of tonus is caused by massive inhibition of motor neurons in the spinal cord. When this happens during waking, the victim of a cataplectic attack loses control of his or her muscles. As in REM sleep, the person continues to breathe and is able to control eye movements. (The brain abnormality responsible for narcolepsy is described later.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cataplexy</strong> is quite different from a narcoleptic sleep attack; cataplexy is usually precipitated by strong emotional reactions or by sudden physical effort, especially if the patient is caught unawares. Laughter, anger, or an effort to catch a suddenly thrown object can trigger a cataplectic attack. In fact, as Guilleminault, Wilson, and Dement (1974) noted, even people who do not have cataplexy sometimes lose muscle strength after a bout of intense laughter. (Perhaps that is why we say a person can become “weak from laughter.”) </p>
<p>There is case reported that a patient had his first cataplectic attack when he was addressing the board of directors of the company he worked for. </p>
<p>Wise (2004) notes that patients with narcolepsy often try to avoid thoughts and situations that are likely to evoke strong emotions because they know that these emotions are likely to trigger cataplectic attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A Dog Undergoing a Cataplectic Attack</p>
<p><img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Biopsychology/image-20201023131825545.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="image-20201023131825545"></p>
<ul>
<li>The attack was triggered by the dog’s excitement at finding some food on the floor. (a) The dog sniffs the food. (b) Muscles begin to relax. (c) The dog is temporarily paralyzed, as it would be during REM sleep.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>REM <strong>sleep paralysis</strong> sometimes intrudes into waking at a time that does not present any physical danger—just before or just after normal sleep, when a person is already lying down. This symptom of narcolepsy is referred to as sleep paralysis , <u>an inability to move just before the onset of sleep or upon waking in the morning</u>. </p>
<p>A person can be snapped out of sleep paralysis by being touched or by hearing someone call his or her name. Sometimes, the mental components of REM sleep intrude into sleep paralysis; that is, the person dreams while lying awake, paralyzed. These episodes, called <strong>hypnagogic hallucinations</strong> , are often alarming or even terrifying. (The term hypnagogic comes from the Greek words hupnos, “sleep,” and agogos, “leading.”) For example, during a hypnagogic hallucination a patient thought that his former roommate was trying to attack him with a hammer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, human narcolepsy is relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately 1&#x2F;2000. This hereditary disorder appears to involve a gene found on chromosome 6, but it is strongly influenced by unknown environmental factors (Mignot, 1998; Mahowald and Schenck, 2005; Nishino, 2007). </p>
<p>Years ago, researchers began a program to maintain breeds of dogs that are afflicted with narcolepsy, with the hopes that discovery of the causes of canine narcolepsy would further our understanding of the causes of human narcolepsy. Lin et al. (1999) discovered that <u>a mutation of a specific gene is responsible for canine narcolepsy</u>. The product of this gene is a receptor for a peptide neurotransmitter called <strong>hypocretin</strong> by some researchers, and called <strong>orexin</strong> by others. </p>
<ul>
<li><u>The name <strong>hypocretin</strong> comes from the fact that the lateral hypothalamus contains the cell bodies of all of the neurons that secrete this peptide</u>. </li>
<li><u>The name <strong>orexin</strong> comes from the role this peptide plays in the control of eating and metabolism</u> (Orexis means “appetite” in Greek.) Two laboratories independently discovered the peptide; hence, it has two names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemelli et al. (1999) prepared <u>a targeted mutation in mice against the orexin gene</u> and found that the animals showed symptoms of narcolepsy. Like human patients with narcolepsy, they went directly into REM sleep from waking and showed periods of cataplexy while they were awake. </p>
<p>Gerashchenko et al. (2001, 2003)  prepared <u>a toxin that attacked only orexinergic neurons</u>, which they then administered to rats. The destruction of the orexin system produced the symptoms of narcolepsy.</p>
<hr>
<p>In humans, narcolepsy appears to be caused by a hereditary autoimmune disorder.</p>
<p>Most patients with narcolepsy are born with orexinergic neurons, but during adolescence the immune system attacks these neurons, and the symptoms of narcolepsy begin. </p>
<p>The symptoms of narcolepsy can be treated with drugs. Sleep attacks can be diminished by stimulants such a methylphenidate (Ritalin), a <strong>catecholamine</strong> agonist (Vgontzas and Kales, 1999).</p>
<p>The REM sleep phenomena (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations) have traditionally been treated with <strong>antidepressant drugs</strong>, which facilitate both serotonergic and noradrenergic activity.</p>
<h3 id="4-REM-Sleep-Behavior-Disorder"><a href="#4-REM-Sleep-Behavior-Disorder" class="headerlink" title="4. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder"></a>4. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</h3><p>As you now know, <strong>REM sleep</strong> is accompanied by <strong>paralysis</strong>. Although neurons in the motor cortex and subcortical motor systems are extremely active during REM sleep (McCarley and Hobson, 1979), people are unable to move at this time. (The occasional twitches that are seen during REM sleep are apparently signs of intense activity of motor neurons that are not completely suppressed.) </p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that people are paralyzed while they dream suggests the possibility that, if not for the paralysis, <u>they would act out their dreams. Indeed, they would.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Schenck et al. (1986) reported the existence of an interesting disorder: <strong>REM sleep behavior disorder</strong> . The behavior of people with this disorder corresponds with the contents of their dreams. </p>

<p>Like narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder appears to be a <strong>neurodegenerative disorder</strong> with at least some <strong>genetic component</strong> (Schenck et al. 1993). </p>
<p>It is often associated with better-known neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (Boeve et al. 2007).</p>

<p>As you might expect, the drugs that are used to treat the symptoms of cataplexy will aggravate the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (Schenck and Mahowald, 1992). REM sleep behavior disorder is usually treated by <strong>clonazepam</strong>, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer(Aurora et al., 2010; Frenette, 2010).</p>

<p>Some maladaptive behaviors occur during slow-wave sleep, especially during its deepest phase, stage 4. These behaviors include bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis), sleepwalking (somnambulism), and night terrors (pavor nocturnus). All three events occur most frequently in children. Often bedwetting can be cured by training methods, such as having a special electronic circuit ring a bell when the first few drops of urine are detected in the bed sheet (a few drops usually precede the ensuing flood). Night terrors consist of anguished screams, trembling, a rapid pulse, and usually no memory of what caused the terror. Night terrors and somnambulism usually cure themselves as the child gets older. Neither of these phenomena is related to REM sleep; <u>a sleepwalking person is not acting out a dream</u>. Especially when it occurs in adulthood, sleepwalking appears to have a genetic component(Hublin et al., 1997).</p>

<p>Sleep-related eating disorder usually responds well to <strong>dopaminergic agonists</strong> or <strong>topiramate</strong>, an <strong>antiseizure medication,</strong> and may be provoked by zolpidem, a benzodiazepine agonist that has been used to treat insomnia (Howell and Schenck, 2009). An increased incidence of nocturnal eating in family members of people with this disorder suggests that heredity may play a role (De Ocampo et al., 2002).</p>
<h2 id="Why-Do-We-Sleep-The-functions-of-Sleep"><a href="#Why-Do-We-Sleep-The-functions-of-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Why Do We Sleep? - The functions of Sleep"></a>Why Do We Sleep? - The functions of Sleep</h2><p>Each night, we slip into a mysterious state that is neither entirely conscious nor unconscious. Sleep has intrigued humans throughout history: </p>
<ul>
<li>Metaphysically, dreaming suggested to our forebears that the soul took leave of the body at night to wander the world; practically, sleep is a period of enforced nonproductivity and vulnerability to predators and enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of thousands of research studies, we are still unclear on the most basic question — What is the function of sleep?</p>
<p>The most obvious explanation is that sleep is <strong>restorative</strong>. Support for this idea comes from the observation that species with <u>higher metabolic rates typically spend more time in sleep</u> (Zepelin &amp; Rechtschaffen, 1974). </p>
<p>A less obvious explanation is the <strong>adaptive hypothesis</strong>; according to this view, the amount of sleep an animal engages in depends on the availability of food and on safety considerations (Webb, 1974).</p>
<h3 id="Sleep-Time"><a href="#Sleep-Time" class="headerlink" title="Sleep Time"></a>Sleep Time</h3><p>Observations support the hypothesis that sleep is an adaptive response to feeding and safety needs</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: Based on data from “Animal Sleep: A Review of Sleep Duration Across Phylogeny,” by S. S. Campbell and I. Tobler, 1984, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 8, pp. 269–300.</li>
<li>Elephants, for instance, which must graze for many hours to meet their food needs, sleep briefly. Animals withlow vulnerability to predators, such as the lion, sleep much of the time, as do animals that find safety by hiding, like bats and burrowing animals. Vulnerable animals that are too large to burrow or hide—for example,horses and cattle—sleep very little. In a study of 39 species, the <u>combined factors of body size and danger</u> accounted for 80% of the variability in sleep time (Allison &amp; Cicchetti, 1976).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="The-Function-of-Clean"><a href="#The-Function-of-Clean" class="headerlink" title="The Function of Clean"></a>The Function of Clean</h3><p>An interesting new idea is that the <u>brain cleanses itself of toxins during sleep.</u> </p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Rochester in New York recently discovered a network of channels formed by glia, which transport cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the brain. By injecting a colored dye in the brains of mice as they slept and a dye of another color when they woke up, the researchers determined that <u>large amounts of CSF flowed through the brain during sleep but not during the awake state</u>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers then injected β-amyloid proteins into the brains of the mice and found that the <u>CSF cleared the proteins out of cells twice as fast during sleep</u> (Xie et al., 2013).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Sleep-deprivation-study"><a href="#Sleep-deprivation-study" class="headerlink" title="Sleep deprivation study"></a>Sleep deprivation study</h4><p><u>Shift workers</u> sleep less than day workers, and their work performance suffers as a result (Tepas &amp; Carvalhais, 1990). With their work and sleep schedules at odds with their biological rhythms, shift workers find that sleep intrudes into their work and daytime arousal interferes with their sleep. </p>
<p>Another study with mice may give us a clue why this happens. After just <u>a few days of sleeping three to five hours a day</u>, the mice had lost 25% of the neurons in the locus coeruleus, a part of the brain that is important for alertness (J. Zhang et al., 2014).</p>
<p>In long-term sleep deprivation studies, impairment follows a rhythmic cycle—<u>performance declines</u> during the night and then shows some recovery during the daytime (Horne, 1988). The persistence of this rhythm represents a safety hazard of gigantic proportions when people try to function at night. The largest number of single-vehicle traffic accidents attributed to “falling asleep at the wheel” occur around 2 a.m. (Mitler et al., 1988), and the number of work errors peaks at the same time (Broughton, 1975). In addition, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident took place at 4 a.m.; the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown began at 1:23 a.m.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Travel across time zones also disrupts sleep and impairs performance, particularly when you travel eastward. It is difficult to quantify the effects of <strong>jet lag</strong>, but three researchers have attempted to do so in a novel way by comparing the performance of baseball teams. When East Coast and West Coast teams played at home, their percentage of wins was nearly identical —50% and 49%, respectively. When they traveled across the continent but had time to adjust to the new time zone, they showed a typical visitor’s disadvantage, winning 45.9% of their games. Teams traveling west without time to adjust won about the same, 43.8% of their games, whereas teams traveling east won only 37.1% (Recht, Lew, &amp; Schwartz, 1995). Sleep quality is better when you extend the day’s length by traveling west, rather than shorten it as you do when you travel east. One way of looking at this effect is that it is easier to stay awake past your bedtime than it is to go to sleep when you are not sleepy. </p>

<hr>
<p>We all know how insistent the urge to sleep can be and how uncomfortable we feel when we have to resist it and stay awake. With the exception of the effects of severe pain and the need to breathe, <u>sleepiness is probably the most insistent drive that we can experience.</u> People can commit suicide by refusing to eat or drink, but even the most stoical person cannot indefinitely defy the urge to sleep. Sleep will come, sooner or later, no matter how hard a person tries to stay awake. </p>
<p>Although the issue is not yet settled, most researchers believe that the primary function of slow-wave sleep is to permit the brain to rest.</p>
<p>In addition, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep promote different types of learning, and REM sleep also appears to promote brain development.</p>
<h3 id="1-Functions-of-Slow-Wave-Sleep"><a href="#1-Functions-of-Slow-Wave-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="1. Functions of Slow-Wave Sleep"></a>1. Functions of Slow-Wave Sleep</h3><p>Sleep is a universal phenomenon among vertebrates. As far as we know, all mammals and birds sleep (Durie, 1981).  Reptiles also sleep, and fish and amphibians enter periods of quiescence that probably can be called sleep. </p>
<ul>
<li>However, only warm-blooded vertebrates (mammals and birds) exhibit unequivocal REM sleep, with muscular paralysis, EEG signs of desynchrony, and rapid eye movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep appears to be essential to survival. Evidence for this assertion comes from the fact that sleep is found in some species of mammals that would seem to be better off without it. </p>
<p>For example, some species of marine mammals have developed an extraordinary pattern of sleep: The cerebral hemispheres take turns sleeping, presumably because that strategy always permits at least one hemisphere to be alert and keep the animal from sinking and drowning. In addition, the eye contralateral to the active hemisphere remains open. </p>
<p>Some birds (for example, mallard ducks) can also sleep with only one hemisphere, keeping the opposite eye open to watch for predators (Rattenborg, Lima, and Amlaner, 1999). </p>
<p><img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Biopsychology/image-20201023133600043.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="image-20201023133600043"></p>
<ul>
<li>The two hemispheres sleep independently, presumably so that the animal remains behaviorally alert.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Effects-of-Sleep-Deprivation"><a href="#Effects-of-Sleep-Deprivation" class="headerlink" title="Effects of Sleep Deprivation"></a>Effects of Sleep Deprivation</h4><p>Sleep deprivation studies with human subjects have provided little evidence that sleep is needed to keep the body functioning normally.</p>
<p>The results of sleep deprivation studies suggest that the restorative effects of sleep are <u>more important for the brain</u> than for the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Fatal familial insomnia</p>
<ul>
<li>A fatal inherited disorder characterized by progressive insomnia.</li>
<li>An inherited neurological disorder called <strong>fatal familial insomnia</strong> results in damage to portions of the <strong>thalamus</strong>(Sforza et al., 1995; Gallassi et al., 1996; Montagna et al., 2003). </li>
<li>The symptoms of this disease, which is related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“mad cow disease”), include <u>deficits in attention and memory</u>, followed by <u>a dreamlike, confused state</u>; loss of control of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system; and <strong>insomnia</strong>. </li>
<li>The first signs of sleep disturbances are <u>reductions in sleep spindles and K complexes</u>. As the disease progresses, <u>slow-wave sleep completely disappears,</u> and only brief episodes of REM sleep (without the accompanying paralysis) remain. </li>
<li>As the name indicates, the disease is fatal. Whether the insomnia, caused by the brain damage, contributes to the other symptoms and to the patient’s death is not known.</li>
</ul>
<p>During slow-wave sleep, both <u>cerebral metabolic rate</u> and <u>cerebral blood flow</u> decline, falling to about 75 percent of the waking level during stage 4 sleep (Sakai et al., 1979; Buchsbaum et al., 1989; Maquet, 1995). </p>
<p>In particular, the regions that have the highest levels of activity during waking show the highest levels of delta waves—and the lowest levels of metabolic activity—during slow-wave sleep. </p>
<p><strong><u>Thus, the presence of slow-wave activity in a particular region of the brain appears to indicate that that region is resting.</u></strong> </p>
<p>As we know from behavioral observation, people are unreactive to all but intense stimuli during slow-wave sleep and, if awakened, act groggy and confused, as if their cerebral cortex has been shut down and has not yet resumed its functioning. </p>
<p>In addition, several studies have shown that missing a single night’s sleep impairs people’s cognitive abilities; presumably, the brain needs sleep to function at peak efficiency(Harrison and Horne, 1998, 1999). These observations suggest that during slow-wave sleep the brain is indeed resting.</p>
<h3 id="2-Functions-of-REM-Sleep"><a href="#2-Functions-of-REM-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="2. Functions of REM Sleep"></a>2. Functions of REM Sleep</h3><p>REM sleep is a time of intense physiological activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eyes dart about rapidly, the heart rate shows sudden accelerations and decelerations, breathing becomes irregular, and the brain becomes more active.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be unreasonable to expect that REM sleep has the same functions as slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>Researchers have long been struck by the fact that the highest proportion of <strong><u>REM sleep is seen during the most active phase of brain development</u></strong>. Perhaps, then, REM sleep plays a role in this process (Siegel, 2005).</p>
<h4 id="Rebound-phenomenon"><a href="#Rebound-phenomenon" class="headerlink" title="Rebound phenomenon"></a>Rebound phenomenon</h4><p>The increased frequency or intensity of a phenomenon after it has been temporarily suppressed; for example, the increase in REM sleep seen after a period of REM sleep deprivation.</p>
<hr>
<p>But if the function of REM sleep is to promote brain development, why do adults have REM sleep? <u>One possibility is that REM sleep facilitates the massive changes in the brain that occur during development but also some of the more modest changes responsible for learning that occur later in life. Evidence does suggest that REM sleep facilitates learning—but so does slow-wave sleep..</u></p>
<h3 id="3-Sleep-and-Learning"><a href="#3-Sleep-and-Learning" class="headerlink" title="3. Sleep and Learning"></a>3. Sleep and Learning</h3><p>Sleep and Learning</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research with both humans and laboratory animals indicates that sleep does more than <u>allow the brain to rest.</u></p>
</li>
<li><p>Sleep also aids in the consolidation of <u>long-term memories</u> (Marshall and Born 2007).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep play different roles in memory consolidation. </p>
<h4 id="Two-Kinds-of-Memory"><a href="#Two-Kinds-of-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Two Kinds of Memory"></a>Two Kinds of Memory</h4><p>There are two major categories of long-term memory: <strong>declarative memory</strong> (also called explicit memory) and <strong>nondeclarative memory</strong> (also called implicit memory).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarative memories</strong> include those that people can talk about, such as memories of past episodes in their lives. They also include memories of the relationships between stimuli or events, such as the spatial relationships between landmarks that permit us to navigate around our environment. </li>
<li><strong>Nondeclarative memories</strong> include those gained through experience and practice that do not necessarily involve an attempt to “memorize” information, such as learning to drive a car, throw and catch a ball, or recognize a person’s face. Research has found that slow-wave sleep and REM sleep play different roles in the consolidation of declarative and nondeclarative memories.</li>
</ul>
<p>During REM sleep, people normally have a high level of consciousness. If we awaken people during REM sleep, they will be alert and clear-headed and will usually be able to describe the details of a dream that they were having. </p>
<p>However, if we awaken people during slow-wave sleep, they will tend to be groggy and confused, and will usually tell us that very little was happening. </p>
<p>So which stages of sleep do you think aid in the consolidation of declarative and nondeclarative memories?</p>
<p>But…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REM sleep</strong> is associated with <strong>nondeclarative memories</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Slow-wave sleep</strong> is associated with declarative memories.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at evidence from two studies that examined the effects of a nap on memory consolidation. Mednick, Nakayama, and Stickgold (2003)  had subjects learn a <u>nondeclarative visual discrimination</u> task at <strong>9:00 a.m.</strong> </p>
<p>The subjects’ ability to perform the task was tested ten hours later, at <strong>7:00 p.m</strong>. Some, but not all, of the subjects took a ninety-minute nap during the day between training and testing. </p>
<p>The investigators recorded the EEGs of the sleeping subjects to determine which of them engaged in REM sleep and <u>which of them did not. (Obviously, all of them engaged in slow-wave sleep</u>, because this stage of sleep always comes first in healthy people.) </p>
<p>The investigators found that the performance of subjects who did not take a nap was worse when they were tested at 7:00 p.m. than it had been at the end of training. </p>
<p>The subjects who engaged only in slow-wave sleep did about the same during testing as they had done at the end of training. </p>
<p><u>However, the subjects who engaged in REM sleep performed significantly better.</u> Thus, REM sleep strongly facilitated the consolidation of a nondeclarative memory. </p>

<ul>
<li>The graph shows the role of REM sleep in learning <u>a nondeclarative visual discrimination task</u>. Only after a ninety-minute nap that included both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep did the subjects’ performance improve.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In the second study, Tucker et al. (2006) trained subjects on two tasks: <strong>a declarative task</strong> (learning a list of paired words) and a <strong>nondeclarative task</strong> (learning to trace a pencil-and-paper design while looking at the paper in a mirror). Afterwards, some of the subjects were permitted to take <u>a nap lasting for about one hour.</u> Their EEGs were recorded, and they were awakened before they could engage in REM sleep. The subjects’ performance on the two tasks was then tested six hours after the original training. The investigators found that compared with subjects who stayed awake, a nap consisting of just slow-wave sleep increased the subjects’ performance on the declarative task but had no effect on performance of the nondeclarative task. </p>
<p>So these two experiments (and many others I have not described) indicate that <u>REM sleep facilitates consolidation of nondeclarative memories</u>, and <u>slow-wave sleep facilitates consolidation of declarative memories.</u></p>

<ol>
<li>Circadian rhythm causes secretion of hormone melatonin at certain time of the day (at the onset of darkness). <strong>Melatonin</strong> tells the body that it is time to rest and sleep.  More of this later…</li>
<li>The chemical <strong>adenosine</strong> acts as a sleep-inducing (hypnogenic) molecule</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Chemical-Control-of-Sleep"><a href="#Chemical-Control-of-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Chemical Control of Sleep"></a>Chemical Control of Sleep</h2><p><strong>Adenosine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A neuromodulator that is released by neurons engaging in high levels of metabolic activity, may play primary role in the initiation of sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chemical <strong>adenosine</strong> acts as a <strong>sleep-inducing</strong> (hypnogenic) molecule. Adenosine is produced by the break up of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during  energy generation to power bodily functions.  The activity of the neurons and gilial cells causes a <strong>build up of adenosine</strong> in the brain and this increases the <strong>sleep pressure</strong>.  </p>
<ul>
<li>After 12 to 16 hours of wakefulness, the level of adenosine and hence the sleep pressure reaches a high value and one has a strong desire to sleep.  During sleep, adenosine is destroyed and after 8 hours of sleep, adenosine levels reach a low value with a correspondingly weaker sleep pressure.  This is shown in the figure:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Biopsychology/image-20201023193804629.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="image-20201023193804629"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adenosine</strong> works by attaching itself to receptor sites in the brain to induce sleep pressure.  Substances like <strong>caffeine</strong> have similar molecular structure to adenosine and are present in tea, coffee, coke and many other food items.  Caffeine attaches to adenosine receptors in the brain and prevents the build up of sleep pressure.  That is why, it is advisable to avoid caffeine 4 to 5 hours before sleeping time in order to ensure a good night sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we all know, people differ in their sleep need. Evidence suggests that genetic factors affect the typical duration of a person’s slow-wave sleep. Rétey et al. (2005) discovered one of these factors—variability in the gene that encodes for an enzyme, <strong>adenosine deaminase</strong>, which is involved in the <u>breakdown of adenosine</u>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The investigators found that people with the G&#x2F;A allele for this gene, which encodes for a form of the enzyme that breaks down adenosine more slowly, spent approximately thirty minutes more time in slow-wave sleep than did people with the more common G&#x2F;G allele.</li>
</ul>
<p>Levels of adenosine in people with the G&#x2F;A allele decreased more slowly during slow-wave sleep, and as a consequence the slow-wave sleep of these people was prolonged.</p>
<h2 id="Neural-Control-of-Arousal"><a href="#Neural-Control-of-Arousal" class="headerlink" title="Neural Control of Arousal"></a>Neural Control of Arousal</h2><p>Circuits of neurons that secrete at least five different neurotransmitters play a role in some aspect of an animal’s level of alertness and wakefulness—what is commonly called arousal: <strong>acetylcholine</strong>, <strong>norepinephrine</strong>, <strong>serotonin</strong>, <strong>histamine</strong>, and <strong>orexin</strong> (Wada et al., 1991; McCormick, 1992; Marrocco, Witte, and Davidson, 1994; Hungs and Mignot, 2001). </p>

<p>In an experiment using optogenetic methods, Carter et al. (2010) found that stimulation of locus coeruleus neurons caused immediate waking, and that inhibition decreased wakefulness and increased slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>Most investigators believe that activity of noradrenergic LC neurons increases an animal’s vigilance—its ability to pay attention to stimuli in the environment. In fact, a study by Aston-Jones et al. (1994) found that the moment-to-moment activity of noradrenergic LC neurons was directly related to the animals’ current performance on a task that required vigilance</p>

<h3 id="6-Orexin"><a href="#6-Orexin" class="headerlink" title="6. Orexin"></a>6. Orexin</h3><p>As we saw in the section on sleep disorders, the cause of narcolepsy is degeneration of <strong>orexinergic neurons</strong> in humans and a hereditary absence of orexin-B receptors in dogs. The cell bodies of neurons that secrete orexin (as we saw, also called hypocretin) are located in the <strong>lateral hypothalamus</strong>. Although there are only about 7000 orexinergic neurons in the human brain, the axons of these neurons project to almost every part of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and all of the regions involved in arousal and wakefulness, including the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus, and acetylcholinergic neurons in the dorsal pons and basal forebrain (Sakurai, 2007). Orexin has an excitatory effect in all of these regions.</p>
<p>As we saw earlier, narcolepsy is most often treated with modafinil, a drug that suppresses the drowsiness associated with this disorder. Ishizuka, Murotani, and Yamatodani (2010) found that the modafinil produces its alerting effects by stimulating the release of orexin in the TMN, which activates the histaminergic neurons located there.</p>
<p>Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus:</p>

<p>Mileykovskiy, Kiyashchenko, and Siegel (2005) recorded the activity of single orexinergic neurons in unanesthetized rats and found that the neurons fired at a high rate during alert or active waking, and at a low rate during quiet waking, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep. </p>
<p>The highest rate of firing was seen when the rats were engaged in exploratory activity. </p>
<p>Adamantidis, Carter, and de Lecea (2010) used optogenetic methods to activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of mice, and found that this activation awakened the animals from either REM or non-REM sleep.</p>

<h2 id="Neural-Control-of-Slow-Wave-Sleep"><a href="#Neural-Control-of-Slow-Wave-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Neural Control of Slow-Wave Sleep"></a>Neural Control of Slow-Wave Sleep</h2><p>Sleep is controlled by three factors: <strong>homeostatic</strong>, <strong>allostatic</strong>, and <strong>circadian</strong>.</p>
<p>If we go without sleep for a long time, we will eventually become sleepy, and once we sleep, we will be likely to sleep longer than usual and make up at least some of our sleep debt. This control of sleep is <strong>homeostatic</strong> in nature.</p>
<p>But under some conditions, it is important for us to stay awake—for example, when we are being threatened by a dangerous situation or when we are dehydrated and are looking for some water to drink. This control of sleep is <strong>allostatic</strong> in nature, and refers to reactions to stressful events in the environment (danger, lack of water, etc.) that serve to <u>override</u> homeostatic control. </p>
<p>Finally, <u>circadian</u> factors, or time of day factors, tend to restrict our period of sleep to a particular portion of the day&#x2F;night cycle. </p>
<ul>
<li>But what controls the activity of the arousal neurons? What causes this activity to fall, thus putting us to sleep? The <strong>preoptic area</strong> , a region of the <strong>anterior hypothalamus</strong>, is the brain region most involved in the initiation of sleep. The <strong>preoptic area</strong> contains neurons whose axons form inhibitory synaptic connections with the brain’s arousal neurons. When our preoptic neurons (let’s call them <strong>sleep neurons</strong>) become active, they suppress the activity of our arousal neurons, and we fall asleep (Saper, Scammell, and Lu, 2005).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Ventrolateral-preoptic-area-vlPOA"><a href="#Ventrolateral-preoptic-area-vlPOA" class="headerlink" title="Ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA)"></a>Ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA)</h4><p><strong>Ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Group of GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area whose activity suppresses alertness and behavioral arousal and promotes sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of the sleep neurons are located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA) . </p>
<p>Damage to vlPOA neurons suppresses sleep (Lu et al., 2000),  and the activity of these neurons, measured by their levels of Fos protein, increases during sleep. </p>
<p>Experiments have shown that the sleep neurons secrete the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and that they send their axons to the <u>five brain regions involved in arousal</u> described in the previous section (Sherin et al., 1998; Gvilia et al., 2006; Suntsova et al., 2007). </p>
<p>As we saw, activity of neurons in these five regions causes cortical activation and behavioral arousal. Inhibition of these regions, then, is a necessary condition for sleep.</p>
<p>The sleep neurons in the <strong>vlPOA</strong> receive inhibitory inputs from some of the same regions they inhibit, including the <strong>tuberomammillary nucleus</strong>, <strong>raphe nuclei</strong>, and <strong>locus coeruleus</strong> (Chou et al., 2002). </p>
<p>As Saper and his colleagues (2001, 2010) suggest, this <u>mutual inhibition</u> may provide the basis for establishing periods of <u>sleep and waking.</u> </p>
<p>They note that <u>reciprocal inhibition</u> also characterizes an electronic circuit known as a <u>flip-flop</u>. A flip-flop can assume one of two states, usually referred to as on or off—or 0 or 1 in computer applications. Thus, either the <strong>sleep neuron</strong>s are active and inhibit the wakefulness neurons or the <strong>wakefulness neurons</strong> are active and inhibit the sleep neurons. </p>
<p>Because these regions are mutually inhibitory, it is impossible for neurons in both sets of regions to be active at the same time. In fact, sleep neurons in the vlPOA are silent until an animal shows a transition from waking to sleep (Takahashi, Lin, and Sakai, 2009).</p>
<h4 id="The-Sleep-Waking-Flip-Flop"><a href="#The-Sleep-Waking-Flip-Flop" class="headerlink" title="The Sleep&#x2F;Waking Flip-Flop"></a>The Sleep&#x2F;Waking Flip-Flop</h4><p><img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Biopsychology/image-20201023211328803.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="image-20201023211328803"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Saper et al. (2001), the major sleep-promoting region (the vlPOA) and the major wakefulness-promoting regions (basal forebrain and pontine regions that contain acetylcholinergic neurons; the locus coeruleus, which contains noradrenergic neurons; the raphe nuclei, which contain serotonergic neurons; and the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, which contains histaminergic neurons) are reciprocally connected by inhibitory GABAergic neurons. (a) When the flip-flop is in the “wake” state, the arousal systems are active, the vlPOA is inhibited, and the animal is awake. (b) When the flip-flop is in the “sleep” state, the vlPOA is active, the arousal systems are inhibited, and the animal is asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>flip-flop</strong> has an important <u>advantage</u>: When it switches from one state to the other, it does so quickly. Clearly, it is most advantageous to be either asleep or awake; a state that has some of the characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness would be maladaptive. </p>
<ul>
<li>However, there is one <u>problem</u> with flip-flops: They can be unstable. In fact, people with narcolepsy and animals with damage to the orexinergic system of neurons exhibit just this characteristic. They have great difficulty remaining awake when nothing interesting is happening, and they have trouble remaining asleep for an extended amount of time</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Saper et al. (2001, 2010) suggest that <u>an important function of orexinergic neurons is to help stabilize the sleep&#x2F;waking flip-flop</u> through their <u>excitatory connections to the wakefulness neurons</u>. Activity of this system of neurons tips the activity of the flip-flop toward the waking state, thus <u>promoting wakefulness and inhibiting sleep.</u> Perhaps your success at staying awake during a boring lecture depends on maintaining a <u>high rate of firing of your orexinergic neurons</u>, which would keep the flip-flop in the waking state. A mathematical model of the sleep&#x2F;waking flip-flop constructed by <u>Rempe, Best, and Terman (2010)</u> confirmed the role of orexigenic neurons in stabilizing the circuit.</p>

<ul>
<li>The schematic diagram shows the effect of activation of the orexinergic system of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus on the sleep&#x2F;waking flip-flop. Motivation to remain awake or events that disturb sleep activate the orexinergic neurons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing that orexinergic neurons help hold the sleep&#x2F;waking flip-flop in the waking state, the obvious question to ask is <u>what factors control the activity of orexinergic neurons?</u> </p>
<p>During the waking part of the day&#x2F;night cycle, orexinergic neurons receive an excitatory signal from the <u>biological clock</u> that controls daily rhythms of sleep and waking. </p>
<p>These neurons also receive signals from brain mechanisms that monitor the animal’s nutritional state: <u>Hunger-related signals activate orexinergic neurons, and satiety-related signals inhibit them</u>. Thus, orexinergic neurons maintain arousal during the times that an animal should search for food. In fact, if normal mice (but not mice with a targeted mutation against orexin receptors) are given less food than they would normally eat, they stay awake longer each day (Yamanaka et al., 2003; Sakurai, 2007). </p>
<p>Finally, orexinergic neurons receive inhibitory input from the vlPOA, which means that sleep signals that arise from the accumulation of adenosine can eventually overcome excitatory input to orexinergic neurons and sleep can occur. </p>

<li>Top: The animal’s activity occurs at “night” (that is, during the twelve hours the light is off). Middle: The period of waking follows the new dark period when the light cycle is changed. Bottom: When the animal is maintained in constant dim illumination, it displays a free-running activity cycle of approximately twenty-five hours, which means that its period of waking begins about one hour later each day.</li>

<ul>
<li>A stimulus (usually the light of dawn) that resets the biological clock that is responsible for circadian rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<p>A free-running clock, with a cycle of approximately twenty-five hours, controls some biological functions—in this case, sleep and wakefulness. Regular daily variation in the level of illumination (that is, sunlight and darkness) normally keeps the clock adjusted to twenty-four hours. Light serves as a zeitgeber (German for “time giver”); it synchronizes the endogenous rhythm. </p>
<p>Studies with many species of animals have shown that if they are maintained in constant darkness (or constant dim light), a brief period of bright light will reset their internal clock, advancing or retarding it, depending upon when the light flash occurs(Aschoff, 1979).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if an animal is exposed to bright light soon after dusk, the biological clock is set back to an earlier time—as if dusk had not yet arrived. On the other hand, if the light occurs late at night, the biological clock is set ahead to a later time—as if dawn had already come. </p>

<li>The SCN controls circadian rhythms in sleep and waking. During the day cycle, the DMH inhibits the vlPOA and excites the brain stem and forebrain arousal systems, thus stimulating wakefulness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Nature-of-the-Clock"><a href="#Nature-of-the-Clock" class="headerlink" title="Nature of the Clock"></a>Nature of the Clock</h4><p>Several studies have demonstrated daily activity rhythms in the SCN, which indicates that the circadian clock is located there.</p>
<p>A study by Schwartz and Gainer (1977) nicely demonstrated day–night fluctuations in the activity of the SCN. </p>

<ul>
<li>The autoradiographs show cross sections through the brains of rats that had been injected with carbon 14-labeled 2-deoxyglucose during the day (top) and the night (bottom). The dark region at the base of the brain (arrows) indicates increased metabolic activity of the suprachiasmatic nuclei.</li>

<p>As a result, levels of the protein would begin to decline, which would remove the inhibition, starting the production cycle again. </p>

<ul>
<li>A gland attached to the dorsal tectum; produces melatonin and plays a role in circadian and seasonal rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Melatonin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A hormone secreted during the night by the pineal body; plays a role in circadian and seasonal rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SCN regulates the pineal gland’s secretion of melatonin.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced sleep phase syndrome</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 4-hour advance in rhythms of sleep and temperature cycles, apparently caused by a mutation of a gene (per2) involved in the rhythmicity of neurons of the SCN.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delayed sleep phase syndrome</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 4-hour delay in rhythms of sleep and temperature cycles, possibly caused by a mutation of a gene (per3) involved in the rhythmicity of neurons of the SCN.</li>
