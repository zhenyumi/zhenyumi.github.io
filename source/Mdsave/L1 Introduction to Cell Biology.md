# 一、Cell Theory

## Discovery of Cells

### 1. 1665 - Robert Hooks

In 1665, Robert Hooke saw a network of tiny box-like compartments that he described “… much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular. . . . these pores, or cells, . . . were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this.

He called these little compartments “cellulae”, a Latin term meaning little room. 

Our present-day term therefore is: “cell”.

In fact, these were cell walls, left by dead cork cells…

### 2. ~1670s - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek 

Improvement of technology: the quality of lenses

![image-20200217132932982](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217132932982.png)

Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe & describe single-celled organisms (“animalcules”).

First to record observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa and blood flow. 

Actually, he was the first to observe live cells

### 3. 1838-1839 - Schleiden & Schwann 

```
Matthias Schleiden & Theodor Schwann proposed the original Cell Theory
```



<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217133028894.png" alt="image-20200217133028894" style="zoom: 80%;" />

Schleiden & Schwann systematically studied tissues of plants and animals under the microscope and showed:

+ Cells are the building blocks of all living things.

+ All cells have similar structure: nucleus and membrane.

Schwann was also famous for the discovery of nerve sheath cells : “Schwann” cells.

### 4. 1858 - Rudolf Virchow

```
Cells derive from pre-existing cells
```

Question:

What is the origin of new cells?

Are new cells from pre-existing cells or is there biogenesis by vitalism?

![image-20200217133238340](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217133238340.png)

Rudolf Virchow proposed cells are from pre-existing cells:

+ *Omnis cellula e cellula*("all cells (come) from cells"), 

+ but there was no experimental proof, until the discovery of Louis Pasteur

### 5. 1860 - Louis Pasteur

```
Louis Pasteur defied “vitalism”, the spontaneous generation of life
```

Louis Pasteur disproved the concept of “vitalism”, the spontaneous generation of life, via his famous swan-neck bottle experiment

Experimentally proved that new cells from pre-existing cells

![image-20200217133447438](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217133447438.png)

####  swan neck flask experiment

Louis Pasteur’s key experiment: swan neck flask experiment

### 6. 1880 - Eduard Strasburger

```
First observation of cell division – additional proof
```

Eduard Strasburger: cell division in hair cell from a Tradescantia flower (紫鸭跖草花)

![image-20200217133712814](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217133712814.png)

## The three tenets

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.

2. The cell is basic unit of structure and function for all organisms.

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells by division.

# 二、Levels of Organization

Cells are “atoms of life”, the least level where organisms are still alive. 

We are made entirely of cells and material produced by cells

The levels of organization:

Molecules 
1. Organelles 
2. Cells 
3. Tissues 
4. Organs 
5. Organisms 
6. Populations
7. Ecosystems or taxonomic groups

# 三、Diversity And Unity of Cell

## Diversity of cells

### 1. Size

Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea

Eukaryotes: Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protists (do not have tissues)

For cells, the <u>size</u> matters: The relationship between the radius, surface area, and volume of a cell

​	![image-20200217134322850](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217134322850.png)

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells

+ The size of cells varies greatly.
+ Most cells are small:
  + Prokaryotic: 1-10 **µ**m 
  + Eukaryotic: 10-100 **µ**m

<font color="FF0000">How do eukaryotic cells handle the large size?</font>

### 2. Prokaryotes Are The Most Diverse

Prokaryotes are the most diverse and numerous cells on earth:

+ Bacteria come in different shape and size. 
+ Some bacteria are photosynthetic
+ Some bacteria get the energy from H2S.

![image-20200217134556322](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217134556322.png)

### 3. Cell Architecture

Eukaryotes have nucleus and organelles

![image-20200217134816353](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217134816353.png)

<font color="FF0000">How do eukaryotic cells evolve?</font>

### 4. Time And Evolution

![image-20200217134929044](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217134929044.png)

#### Evolution of eukaryotic cells

It is still a mystery how the primordial eukaryotic cell evolved!

+ Eukaryotic cells may have originated as predators.

Organelle genesis：

##### (1) Phagocytosis in eukaryotic cells

![image-20200217135050042](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217135050042.png)

![image-20200217135057613](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217135057613.png)

## The Unity of Cells

### 1. The essential characteristics of cells

What defines a cell?

Basically, cells are chemical systems.

Cells are composed of small molecules, from which large polymers are assembled to execute the cell function, but with remarkable constancy. 

Nothing in cells disobeys chemical and physical laws. 

However, cells are much more complicated than any other known chemical system. 

<font color="FF0000">How is this achieved?</font>

### 2. Genetic Information Determines

Genetic information determines the nature of whole multicellular organisms

The fertilized egg cell contains all required information

#### Representative genomes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162217331.png" alt="image-20200217162217331" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### How is the genome expanded?

Four ways of genetic innovation:

1. Mutations
2. Duplications
3. DNA Shuffling
4. Horizontal gene transfer (versus vertical transfer from parent to progeny)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162306552.png" alt="image-20200217162306552" style="zoom:67%;" />

New genes are generated from pre-existing genes

#### Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)

##### (1) HGT in Prokaryotic Cells

HGT occurs in prokaryotic cells within the same species or between species

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162340164.png" alt="image-20200217162340164" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Three ways of horizontal gene transfer:

1. Transformation (transfer/uptake of free DNA)
2. Conjugation (Cell to cell transfer of plasmid DNA)
3. Transduction (Transfer by viral delivery) 

##### (2) HGT in higher organisms

![image-20200217162447590](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162447590.png)

Horizontal gene transfer in higher organisms:

+ Fusion of sperm cell & egg cell (sexual reproduction)

+ HGT also occurs in human via virus infection

##### (3) genes evolve 

Some genes evolve rapidly, while others not

Random mutation of DNA occurs during DNA replication : for the better or the worse

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162741857.png" alt="image-20200217162741857" style="zoom: 80%;" />

### 3. The astonishing constancy of all cells

The four points to remember

![image-20200217162957825](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217162957825.png)

# 五、Model organisms

## The application of model systems to study cell biology

Use of yeast as a model system to study cell division

Use of *Caenorhabditis elegans* as a model system to study behavior

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217163211493.png" alt="image-20200217163211493" style="zoom:80%;" />

<center>Yeast</center>
## Model systems commonly used in cell biology 

![image-20200217163539500](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217163539500.png)

### 1. Less common model organisms

![image-20200217163557357](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217163557357.png)

### 2. Humans report on our own

1. Medical examination
2. Self-reporting

![image-20200217163631173](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200217163631173.png)

## Why Model Systems

When choose a model system consider the following:

3. Short life cycle
4. Easy manipulation
5. Costs of the system (the cheaper the better)
6. Ethical considerations
7. Mutations available
6. Size of the genome (the smaller the better)
