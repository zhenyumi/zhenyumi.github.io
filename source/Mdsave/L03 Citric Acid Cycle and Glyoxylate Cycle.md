# 一、Overview of Pyruvate Oxidation and the Citric Acid Cycle

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226101545391.png" alt="image-20200226101545391" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The citric acid cycle is the <u>central oxidative pathway in respiration</u>, the process by which all metabolic <u>fuels—carbohydrate, lipid, and protein</u>—are catabolized in aerobic organisms and tissues.

Most of the energy yield from substrate oxidation in the citric acid cycle comes from <u>subsequent reoxidation of reduced electron carriers</u>.

## The three stages of respiration

1. Stage 1 - carbon from metabolic fuels is incorporated into <u>acetyl-CoA</u>. 
2. Stage 2 - the <u>citric acid cycle</u> oxidizes acetyl-CoA to produce CO2, <u>reduced electron carriers</u>, and a small amount of ATP.  经过cycle (Stage 2)之后，消耗了acetyl-CoA里面的两个C，其余的物质都没有改变
3. Stage 3 - the reduced electron carriers are <u>reoxidized</u>, providing energy for the synthesis of additional <u>ATP</u>.

**Dehydrogenases（脱氢酶）** catalyze <u>substrate oxidations</u>.

**Oxidases（氧化酶）** catalyze the subset of oxidations in which <u>O~2~ is the direct electron acceptor</u>.

**Oxygenase（加氧酶）**: oxygen combines directly with the substrate oxidized.

## The fate of carbon in the citric acid cycle

Note that these departing CO2 groups derive from the two <u>oxaloacetate carboxyl groups</u> that were incorporated as acetyl-CoA in earlier turns of the cycle.

# 二、Pyruvate Oxidation: A Major Entry Route for Carbon into the Citric Acid Cycle

Pyruvate oxidation to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by the pyruvate **dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex, 丙酮酸脱氢酶复合物)**. 

It is an **oxidative decarboxylation (氧化脱羧)**, which is virtually <u>irreversible</u> involving <u>three enzymes</u> and <u>five coenzymes.</u>  由于这个反应不可逆，也不能bypass， 因此偶数碳的脂肪酸不能变成糖

<u>Five-step reactions</u>
<u>Five coenzymes</u>

# 三、Coenzymes Involved in Pyruvate Oxidation and the Citric Acid Cycle

In pyruvate oxidation, the acceptor of the **active aldehyde (hydroxyethyl group, 羟乙基)** generated by TPP is lipoic acid, which is the internal disulfide of **6,8-dithiooctanoic acid**. (6,8-二硫代辛酸)

The coenzyme is joined to via an <u>amide</u> bond linking the carboxyl group of lipoic acid to a lysine -amino group. Thus, the reactive species is an amide, called **lipoamide (硫辛酰胺)**, or **lipoyllysine**. 

<u>Each lipoyllysine side chain</u> is ~14Å long, and is located within a flexible lipoyl domain of E~2~ (and E~3~BP), allowing it to function as a “<u>swinging arm (摆臂)</u>” that can interact with the active sites of both the <u>E~1~ and E~3~</u> components of the PDH complex.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226195659868.png" alt="image-20200226195659868" style="zoom:67%;" />

Lipoic acid:  10 tons of pork and beef → 30 mg;  “swinging arm” for acetyl group between E~1~ and E~3~

## Oxidized and reduced forms of lipoamide

The cyclic disulfide of lipoamide can undergo a reversible two-electron reduction to form the dithiol, **dihydrolipoamide (二硫醇，二氢硫辛酸)**.

In pyruvate dehydrogenase, this reduction is coupled to the transfer of the <u>hydroxyethyl group moiety from TPP</u>, giving an **acetyl thioester** of the reduced dihydrolipoamide.

Thus, <u>lipoamide is a carrier of both electrons and acyl groups</u>.

Flavin coenzymes participate in two-electron oxidoreduction reactions that can proceed in <u>2 one-electron steps.</u>

![image-20200226195921963](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226195921963.png)

<u>FAD and FMN(B2, riboflavin): coenzyme; two electrons acceptor, hold electrons, not diffusing them; tightly binds to the protein.</u>

Coenzyme A (<u>A for acyl（脂肪酰基）</u>) participates in <u>activation of acyl groups</u> in general, including the acetyl group derived from pyruvate.

The coenzyme is derived metabolically from <u>ATP, the vitamin pantothenic acid, and β-mercaptoethylamine</u>.

![image-20200226200008335](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200008335.png)

**Thioesters (硫酯类)** such as acetyl-CoA are energy rich because thioesters are destabilized relative to ordinary oxygen esters.

硫酯键具有较高的能量，高于氧酯键

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200031306.png" alt="image-20200226200031306" style="zoom:67%;" />

## Comparison of free energies of hydrolysis of thioesters and oxygen esters

<u>Lack of resonance stabilization</u> in thioesters is the basis for the higher $\Delta$G of hydrolysis of thioesters, relative to that of ordinary oxygen esters. 

The free energies of the hydrolysis products are similar for the two classes of compounds.

# 四、Action of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

## Mechanisms of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex

**Substrate channeling**: intermediates of a multiple pathways are “handed off” from one active site to the next without diffusing from the the complex; allows the overall reaction to proceed smoothly and avoids unwanted side reactions.

E1: pyruvate dehydrogenase (丙酮酸脱氢酶)
E2: dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (二氢硫辛酰胺转乙酰酶)
E3: dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (二氢硫辛酰胺脱氢酶)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200150508.png" alt="image-20200226200150508" style="zoom: 25%;" />

**Lipoamide (硫辛酰胺)** is tethered to one enzyme (E~2~) in the PDH complex, but it interacts with all three enzymes via a flexible swinging arm.

![image-20200226200227023](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200227023.png)

**Arsenic poisoning (砷中毒)**, both intentional and unintentional, has had a long history, dating back to at least the eighth century. 

**Trivalent As(III)** compounds such as **arsenite (亚砷酸盐)** and organic arsenicals react readily with **thiols（硫醇）**, and they are especially reactive with **dithiols（二硫醇类）**, <u>such as dihydrolipoamide</u>, forming bidentate adducts:

# 五、The Citric Acid Cycle

## Step 1: Introduction of Two Carbon Atoms as Acetyl-CoA


The initial reaction, catalyzed by **citrate synthase (柠檬酸合成酶)**, is akin to an <u>aldol condensation (羟醛缩合)</u>.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200626328.png" alt="image-20200226200626328" style="zoom:80%;" />

反应放出大量能量，倾向于正向进行，受到Oxaloacetate浓度调节

### 1. Mechanism of the citrate synthase reaction

Mechanism of the citrate synthase reaction: 

Step 1: **Asp 375** extracts a proton from the methyl group,and **His 274** donates a proton to the carbonyl oxygen of **acetyl-CoA**, creating an **enol (烯醇)**. 

Step 2: **His 274** deprotonates the acetyl-CoA enol, stabilizing the nucleophilic enolate that attacks the keto carbon of **oxaloacetate**. His 320 protonates the aldol product (S)-citroyl-CoA. 

Step 3:The **citroyl-CoA** intermediate spontaneously hydrolyzes to citrate by a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction giving exclusively the S stereoisomer of citroyl-CoA.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226200750256.png" alt="image-20200226200750256" style="zoom:30%;" />

### 2. Three-dimensional structure of citrate synthase

The two forms of <u>pig heart citrate synthase</u> homodimer shown here were determined by crystallographic methods and support the induced fit model of enzyme catalysis. 

1. In the <u>absence of CoA-SH</u> the enzyme crystallizes in an <u>“open” form</u>. Citrate binds at the base of large clefts in both catalytic domains of the homodimeric protein. 
2. <u>Binding of CoA-SH</u> causes the enzyme to adopt a <u>“closed” conformation,</u> with the clefts essentially filled

![image-20200226201128853](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201128853.png)

## Step 2: Isomerization of Citrate

The **tertiary alcohol** of **citrate** presents yet another chemical problem: tertiary alcohols <u>cannot be oxidized</u> without breaking a carbon–carbon bond. 

To set up the next oxidation in the pathway, citrate is converted to **isocitrate**, a chiral **secondary alcohol**, which can be <u>more readily oxidized</u>. 

This isomerization reaction, catalyzed by **aconitase (乌头酸酶)**, <u>involves successive dehydration and hydration,</u> through cis-aconitate as a dehydrated intermediate, which remains enzyme-bound.

这个反应是一个可逆反应，在细胞内ΔG = 0

![image-20200226201225323](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201225323.png)

The enzyme contains nonheme iron and acid-labile sulfur in a cluster called a 4Fe–4S iron–sulfur center. 

The iron–sulfur cluster coordinates the hydroxyl group and one of the carboxyl groups on the citrate molecule.

The cis-aconitate intermediate must flip 180° during the reaction, presumably by releasing from the enzyme, then rebinding with the iron–sulfur cluster, but in the opposite orientation. 

Thus, of the four possible **diastereomers (非对映异构体)** of isocitrate, only one, the 2R,3S diastereomer, is produced.

![image-20200226201330546](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201330546.png)

The **prochirality (前手性)** of citrate when bound to aconitase:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201347965.png" alt="image-20200226201347965" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Fluoroacetate (氟乙酸)** is an example of a <u>mechanism-based</u>, or <u>suicide</u>, <u>inhibitor of aconitase</u>. (2-Fluorocltrate与柠檬酸结构相似，因此使得aconitase错误识别)

![image-20200226201406364](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201406364.png)

“<u>Suicide substrate</u>”: Not toxic to cell itself, but it resembles a normal metabolic closely enough that it undergoes metabolic transformation to a product that does inhibit a crucial enzyme. The cell “comments suicide” by transforming the analog to a toxic product.

## Step 3: Generation of CO2 by an NAD+-Linked Dehydrogenase


The first of two <u>oxidative decarboxylations</u> in the cycle is catalyzed by **isocitrate dehydrogenase (异柠檬酸脱氢酶)**. 

Isocitrate is oxidized to a ketone, **oxalosuccinate (草酰琥珀酸)**, an unstable enzyme-bound intermediate that **spontaneously β-decarboxylates** to give the product, **α-ketoglutarate**. 

The strategy here is to oxidize isocitrate’s secondary alcohol to α keto group β to the carboxyl group to be removed. 

The β-keto group acts as an electron sink to stabilize the **carbanionic (碳负离子)** transition state, facilitating decarboxylation.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226201947387.png" alt="image-20200226201947387" style="zoom:80%;" />

<u>Two carbon</u> atoms enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl-CoA, and two are lost as CO2 in the oxidative decarboxylations of <u>steps 3 and 4</u>.

## Step 4:	Generation of a Second CO2 by an Oxidative Decarboxylation


This is a multistep reaction entirely analogous to the <u>pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction</u>. 

An α-keto acid substrate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation, with concomitant formation of an acyl-CoA thioester.

![image-20200226202119677](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202119677.png)

<u>3 enzymes, 5 reactions, 5 coenzymes</u>

### 1. Decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate

The first step catalyzed out by the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is a decarboxylation catalyzed by a-ketoglutarate decarboxylase (E~1~ of the complex), producing a four-carbon TPP derivative.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202221307.png" alt="image-20200226202221307" style="zoom:60%;" />

## Step 5: A Substrate-Level Phosphorylation

<u>Succinyl-CoA is an energy-rich thioester compound</u>, and its potential energy is used to drive the formation of a nucleoside triphosphate 

This reaction, catalyzed by **succinyl-CoA synthetase (琥珀酰辅酶A合成酶)**, is comparable to the <u>two</u> substrate-level phosphorylation reactions that we encountered in <u>glycolysis</u>, except that in animal cells the energy-rich nucleotide product is not always ATP but, in some tissues, <u>GTP</u>.

![image-20200226202315076](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202315076.png)

### 1. Covalent catalysis by the succinyl-CoA synthetase reaction

Three successive nucleophilic substitution reactions conserve the energy of the thioester of succinyl-CoA in the **phosphoanhydride bond (磷酸酐键)** of ATP (or GTP).

An active site histidine side chain is transiently phosphorylated (N-phosphohistidine) during the reaction.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202352814.png" alt="image-20200226202352814" style="zoom:20%;" />

A **charge–dipole interaction (电荷偶极相互作用)** stabilizes the phosphohistidine intermediate in the succinyl-CoA synthetase reaction. 

In this schematic, based on the E. coli enzyme structure, the permanent dipoles of two -helices (the “power” helices) are oriented such that the d+ at their N-termini interact with the negative charges on the phosphate group of the active site N-phosphohistidine, stabilizing this transient reaction intermediate.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202441241.png" alt="image-20200226202441241" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Step 6: A Flavin（黄素）-Dependent Dehydrogenation

Completion of the cycle involves conversion of the four-carbon succinate to the four-carbon oxaloacetate. 

The first of the three reactions, catalyzed by **succinate dehydrogenase (琥珀酸脱氢酶)**, is the **FAD**-dependent dehydrogenation of two saturated carbons to a double bond.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202520718.png" alt="image-20200226202520718" style="zoom:67%;" />

Complex II:  <u>Embedded in the membrane, tightly bound to the mitochondrial membrane</u>

**Succinate dehydrogenase** is competitively inhibited by **malonate (丙二酸)**, a <u>structural analog</u> of succinate. Malonate inhibition of pyruvate oxidation was one of the clues that led Krebs to propose the cyclic nature of this pathway.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202554757.png" alt="image-20200226202554757" style="zoom:67%;" />

A single C-C bond is more difficult to oxidize than a C-O bond.

Therefore, the redox coenzyme for succinate dehydrogenase is not NAD+ but the more powerful oxidant FAD. 

The flavin is bound covalently to the enzyme protein through a specific histidine residue.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202628169.png" alt="image-20200226202628169" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Step 7: Hydration of a Carbon–Carbon Double Bond


The <u>stereospecific（立体特异性） trans</u> hydration of the carbon–carbon double bond is catalyzed by **fumarate hydratase**, more commonly called **fumarase (延胡索酸酶)**.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202659262.png" alt="image-20200226202659262" style="zoom:59%;" />

## Step 8:	A Dehydrogenation that Regenerates
	Oxaloacetate

Finally, the cycle is completed with the **NAD+**–dependent dehydrogenation of malate to oxaloacetate, catalyzed by **malate dehydrogenase (苹果酸脱氢酶)**.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226202739090.png" alt="image-20200226202739090" style="zoom:67%;" />

One turn of the citric acid cycle generates <u>one high-energy phosphate (ATP or GTP)</u> through substrate-level phosphorylation, plus <u>three NADH and one FADH2</u> for subsequent reoxidation in the electron transport chain.

# 七、Regulation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase and the Citric Acid Cycle

## Regulation

Major regulatory factors controlling pyruvate dehydrogenase and the citric acid cycle: 

Red brackets indicate concentration dependence. 

NADH can inhibit through allosteric interactions, but apparent NADH inhibition can also be a reflection of reduced NAD+ availability.

## Pyruvate Dehydrogenase

Regulation of the <u>mammalian</u> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex <u>by **feedback inhibition（反馈抑制(allosteric)）** and by **covalent modification（共价修饰）** of E~1~.</u> 

<u>A kinase and a phosphatase inactivate and activate the first component (E1)</u> of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating, <u>respectively</u>, three specific serine residues.

The active form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is <u>feedback inhibited by acetyl-CoA and NADH.</u>

# 八、Anaplerotic Sequences: The Need to Replace Cycle Intermediates

![image-20200226203236154](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226203236154.png)

Citric acid cycle intermediates used in biosynthetic pathways <u>must be replenished</u> (补充) to maintain flux through the cycle.

+ 因此相关底物的浓度不仅与cycle反应的活性有关，同时与代谢网络内的其他反应有关

Anaplerotic pathways serve this purpose.

### 1. Pyruvate Carboxylase

+ 这个反应需要cofactor -- biotin

### 2. phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)

Because <u>phosphoenolpyruvate</u> is such an energy-rich compound, this reaction, catalyzed by **phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase**, requires <u>neither an energy cofactor nor biotin</u>. This reaction is important in the <u>C4 pathway of photosynthetic CO2 fixation</u>

### 3. malate dehydrogenase

In addition to <u>pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase</u>, a third anaplerotic process is provided by an enzyme commonly known as **malic enzyme** but more officially as **malate dehydrogenase (苹果酸酶)** (decarboxylating: NADP+).

The malic enzyme catalyzes the <u>reductive carboxylation</u> of pyruvate to give malate.

## Mechanism of the biotin-dependent pyruvate carboxylase reaction

Phase I is catalyzed by the biotin carboxylation (BC) domain.
Phase II is catalyzed by the carboxyltransferase (CT) domain.

# 九、Glyoxylate Cycle: An Anabolic Variant of the Citric Acid Cycle

The **glyoxylate cycle (乙醛酸循环)** allows plants and bacteria to carry out net conversion of <u>fat</u> to carbohydrate, bypassing CO2-generating reactions of the citric acid cycle.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226203703424.png" alt="image-20200226203703424" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Reactions of the glyoxylate cycle

<u>Two acetyl-CoA</u> molecules enter the cycle, one at the **citrate synthase** step, and the second at the **malate synthase** step. 

The reactions catalyzed by **isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (异柠檬酸裂合酶和苹果酸合成酶)** <u>bypass the three citric acid cycle steps between isocitrate and succinate</u> so that the two carbons lost in the citric acid cycle are saved, resulting in the <u>net synthesis of oxaloacetate.</u>

## Intracellular relationships involving the glyoxylate cycle <u>in plant cells</u>

**Fatty acids** released in lipid bodies are oxidized in <u>glyoxysomes</u> to <u>acetyl-CoA</u>, which can also come directly from <u>acetate</u>. 

Acetyl-CoA is then converted to succinate in the glyoxylate cycle, and the <u>succinate</u> is transported to <u>mitochondria</u>. 

There it is converted in the citric acid cycle to <u>oxaloacetate</u>, which is readily converted to <u>sugars</u> by <u>gluconeogenesis</u>.
