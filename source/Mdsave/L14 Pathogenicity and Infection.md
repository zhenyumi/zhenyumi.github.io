# 一、Overview of Pathogen

## Pathogen

1. **primary (frank) pathogen** 原生病原体 - causes disease by direct interaction with healthy host (e.g., HIV)

2. **opportunistic pathogen** 机会性感染，伺机性感染 - may be part of normal flora and causes disease when it has gained access to other tissue sites or host is immunocompromised, (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa)

3. **animate** 有生命的 (humans or animals)

4. **inanimate** (water, soil, food)

## The Chain of Infection

Chain of events for a successful infection

1. agent **identity**
2. **virulence**（毒力，病毒性） of agent
3. **dose** of agent
4. means of **exposure** to agent
5. **susceptibility** of host to agent

1. incubation period 疾病潜伏期

   > 疾病潜伏期是接触病原体（可以是微生物或者是化学制剂、辐射等）后，症状和体征有明显的表现前所经过的时间。疾病潜伏期可能短至只有几分钟，或者长达几十年（克雅氏病大概为30年）。潜伏期内的传染病同样具有传染性

2. prodromal stage 前驱期 

3. period of illness 疾病时期

4. convalescence 康复;恢复期

## Infectious Dose

## Invasion

Penetration can be active or passive

**active** occurs through lytic substances which

+ attack the extracellular matrix and basement membranes
+ degrade carbohydrate-protein complexes between cells
+ disrupt host cell surface

**passive** (e.g., skin lesions 皮损 , insect bites, wounds)

+ involves production of specific products and/or
+ enzymes that promote spreading

### 4. Biofilm

Biofilm growth

+ become less sensitive to antibiotics

+ increases virulence

+ make cells in biofilm more resistant to host defense

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218135423107.png" alt="image-20191218135423107" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Resisting Host Defenses

Infection of immune system cells

Fuse with adjacent cells to prevent exposure to antimicrobial proteins in host

Capsules prevent phagocytosis

Mutations change antigenic sites or alter expression of antigens

Produce substances that resemble host tissue

Produce proteases that degrade host proteins

Special proteins that interfere with host defenses

## Pathogen Transmission

Initial transmission of pathogen to host

+ evidence suggests correlation between mode of transmission and degree of virulence
  + direct contact → less virulent
  + vector-borne → highly virulent
  + greater ability to survive outside host → more virulent

##### (3) Complement Fixation

Binding of complement to an antigen-antibody complex

Basis of diagnostic tests that determine if antibodies to an antigen are present in patient's serum

Very sensitive, measure extremely small amounts of antibody

![image-20191218152112879](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152112879.png)

##### (4) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

One of the most widely used serological tests

+ detect antigen and antibody

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152237936.png" alt="image-20191218152237936" style="zoom:33%;" />

![image-20191218152251563](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152251563.png)

##### (5) Immunoblotting (Western Blotting)

Procedure

1. proteins separated by electrophoresis

+ transferred to membrane

2. protein bands visualized withenzyme-tagged antibodies

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152613553.png" alt="image-20191218152613553" style="zoom:67%;" />

##### (6) Immunoprecipitation 免疫沉淀法

Detects soluble Ag reacting with Ab

Binding of Ab to Ag forms lattice that precipitates

Lattice formation occurs only in optimal ratio of Ag to Ab

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152730775.png" alt="image-20191218152730775" style="zoom:50%;" />

##### (7) Immunodiffusion 免疫扩散

Precipitation reaction that occurs in agar gel medium

Two commonly used techniques

1. **single** radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay (antibody in agar, antigen diffuses)
   + quantitates antigen

2. **double** diffusion agar assay
   + antibody and antigen both diffuse
   + identifies antigens

![image-20191218152955325](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218152955325.png)

Antigens first separated by electrophoresis according to charge

Antigens visualized by precipitation reaction

Has greater resolution than immunodiffusion assays

##### (9) Radioimmunoassay (RIA)

Purified antigen labeled with radioisotope competes with unlabeled standard for antibody binding

Amount of radioactivity associated with antibody is measured

![image-20191218153705970](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218153705970.png)

# 四、Epidemiology

Science that evaluates **occurrence**, **determinants**, **distribution**, and **control** of health and disease in a defined human population

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218153923735.png" alt="image-20191218153923735" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Chinese Center For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC)

Worldwide counterpart is the World Health Organization (WHO) located in Geneva, Switzerland

## Epidemiology Terminology 流行病学术语

1. Sporadic disease 偶发病
   + occurs occasionally and at irregular intervals

2. Endemic disease 地方性流行 Endemic (epidemiology)
   + maintains a relatively steady low-level frequency at a moderately regular interval

3. Hyperendemic disease 高流行性疾病
   + gradually increase in occurrence frequency above endemic level but not to epidemic level

4. Outbreak （疾病的）发作
   + sudden, unexpected occurrence of disease
   + usually focal or in a limited segment of population

5. Epidemic 流行病
   + sudden increase in frequency above expected number

6. Pandemic 瘟疫
   + increase in disease occurrence within large population over wide region (usually worldwide)

## Measuring Infectious Frequency

Measure disease frequency at single time points and over time

Three important statistical measures of disease frequency

1. morbidity rate
2. prevalence rate
3. mortality rate

## Patterns of Infectious Disease in a Population

Two types of epidemics

1. common source epidemic
   + single common contaminated source (food)

2. propagated epidemic
   + one infected individual into a susceptible group, infection propagated to others

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218154848402.png" alt="image-20191218154848402" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Herd Immunity

Resistance of a population to infection and to spread of an infectious organism because of the immunity of a large percentage of the population

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218184536256.png" alt="image-20191218184536256" style="zoom:50%;" />

Level can be altered by changes in pathogen

1. **antigenic drift** (抗原（性）漂移) - smaller antigenic changes

2. **antigenic shift** (抗原（性）转变) - major change in antigenic character of pathogen

## Prevention and Control of Epidemics

Three types of control measures

1. reduce or eliminate source or reservoir of infection
2. break connection between source and susceptible individual
3. reduce number of susceptible individuals

### 1. Vaccines and Immunization

![image-20191218185134126](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191218185134126.png)

### 2. Adjuvants

Are mixed with antigens in vaccines to enhance the rate and degree of immunization prolongs antigen interaction with immune cells and stimulates the immune response to the antigen
