# 一、Stem cells and stem cell renewal

## The Intestinal Epithelia Cells

![image-20200508163327811](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163327811.png)

Intestinal epithelial stem cells resides in crypts at the base

![image-20200508163352652](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163352652.png)

Intestinal differentiated cells are derived from stem cells at the crypt

## Stem cells definition

All tissues need to be renewed, but specialization do not allow for cell division

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the potential for self-renewal and differentiation
+ Self-renewal: at least one of the daughter cells is identical to the parent!

### 1. Wnt maintains stem cell niche in intestinal epithelia

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163544797.png" alt="image-20200508163544797" style="zoom: 43%;" />

The cell division of the stem cells and differentiated cells in the intestine is regulated by **mitogens (有丝分裂原)** and anti-mitogens. 

<font color="EE0000">Wnt</font> stimulates cell proliferation in crypts of intestinal epithelium, where as **anti-mitogens** (<font color="EE0000">BMP, TGF-β</font>) inhibit cell proliferation further up the intestinal epithelium

![image-20200508163708818](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163708818.png)

Co-receptor: <font color="EE0000">**LRP** ( LDL-receptor-related protein)</font> and <font color="EE0000">Frizzled</font>
+ Latent transcription regulators: <font color="EE0000">β-catenin</font>
+ Scaffold protein:
   + Adenomatous polyposis coli (<font color="EE0000">APC</font>)
   + <font color="EE0000">axin</font>

Mutated **APC** leads to elevated **beta-catenin** in nucleus and cell proliferation:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163737016.png" alt="image-20200508163737016" style="zoom: 33%;" />

+ **Wn**t signaling maintains cell proliferation in the crypts, and overactivation of the **Wnt** pathway gives rise to tumors.
+ A mutation in the other **Apc** (<u>Adenomatous polyposis coli</u>) gene copy, occurring in a colon epithelial cell during adult life, has given rise to a clone of cells that behave as though the **Wnt** signaling pathway is permanently activated

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508163906530.png" alt="image-20200508163906530" style="zoom:50%;" />

**APC** is tumor suppressor that mediates degradation of **β-catenin**

#### Lgr5-expressing cell in culture can generate an entire organized crypt-villus system

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508164318145.png" alt="image-20200508164318145" style="zoom:80%;" height=750/>

<font color="EE0000">Lgr5</font> is one of Wnt-signaling responsive genes, which encodes a receptor for the signal molecules called <font color="EE0000">R-spondin</font>. 

Genesis of mini-gut from single in vitro cultured Lrg5-expressing cell

##### (1)  ephrin induces growth cone collapse through activating Rho GTPase

![image-20200508164911846](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508164911846.png)

Ephrin (extracellular signaling proteins ) binds and activates the Eph family of RTKs (EphA4) on the surface of motor neurons

Helps guide the migrating tip of the axon (called a growth cone) to its muscle target

##### (2) A repulsive interaction based on ephrin-Eph interaction

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508164927149.png" alt="image-20200508164927149" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### 2. Notch pathway and differentiation

![image-20200508165012608](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165012608.png)

In fly neural cells, when a precursor cell commits to becoming a neural cell, it signals to its immediate neighbors not to do the same; the inhibited cells develop into epidermal cells instead. This process is called **lateral inhibition**.

This depends on a contact-dependent signaling mechanism that is activated by a single-pass transmembrane signal protein called <font color="EE0000">Delta</font> that activates <font color="EE0000">Notch</font> receptors.

By activation, **Notch** cleaved and its tail migrates to nucleus where activates responsible genes

#### The processing and activation of Notch

![image-20200508165156608](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165156608.png)

3-step proteolytic processing
1. The first proteolytic processing step occurs within the **trans Golgi network** to generate the mature heterodimeric **Notch receptor** that is then displayed on the cell surface. 
2. The binding to **Delta** on a neighboring cell triggers the next two proteolytic steps: 
   + **Delta-Notch complex** is endocytosed by the **Delta expressing cell,** exposing the extracellular **cleavage site** in the **transmembrane Notch subunit**. 
3. The released Notch tail migrates into the nucleus, where it binds to the <font color="EE0000">Rbpsuhprotein</font>, which it converts from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator.

#### Notch signaling controls gut cell diversification and helps maintain the stem-cell state

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165223538.png" alt="image-20200508165223538" style="zoom: 43%;" />

**Paneth cells** create **stem cell niche**

+ The **paneth cells** generate signals, including a strong **Wnt** signal, that act over a short range to maintain the stem-cell state. 
+ Signal proteins from the connective tissue surrounding the crypt base help to reinforce the localizing signal from the Paneth cells

## The cell lineage: tracing the origin of a cell

Pathway from stem cells to lineage-restricted progenitors to differentiated cells.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165341882.png" alt="image-20200508165341882" style="zoom:80%;" />

### 1. Stem cells at the crypt base are multipotent

#### Clonal Analysis

![image-20200508165422345](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165422345.png)

## Cell Fate Determination

Two ways for a stem cell to produce daughters with different fates

![image-20200508165501272](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165501272.png)

### 1. Example: The epidermal stem-cell system Renewal

![image-20200508165531689](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508165531689.png)

### 2. Other tissue renewal 

Tissue renewal that do not depend on stem cells
+ Insulin-secreting cell (<font color="EE0000">β-cell</font>)
+ Hepatocytes

Some tissues lack stem cells and are not renewable
+ Auditory epithelium 
+ retina


# 二、Cell reprogramming and pluripotent stem cells

## Animal cloning: reverse differentiation

Cloned animal by the transfer of a nucleus of a differentiated somatic cell into an enucleated egg

![image-20200508170413404](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508170413404.png)

## Different types of stem cells

![image-20200508170958192](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508170958192.png)

+ Stem cells can be named after their location/fate or according to their differentiation capability

A fertilized egg or an equivalent cell produced by nuclear transplantation, is said to be totipotent

but in a strict sense it is not a stem cell because it is not self-renewing, and instead dedicated to a program of progressive differentiation.

### 1. Pluri-, multi- & mono-potent stem cells

Pluripotent cells can differentiate into a wide variety of cells, but can not differentiate to form the whole organism.
+ Examples:
   + embryonic stem cells
   + bone marrow stromal stem cells
   + nerve stem cells
   + embryonic germ

Multi- and mono-potent stem cells can differentiate into a few types of cells or only in a special type of cells, respectively
+ Examples:
   + neuroglial cells
   + nerve stem cells
   + satellite cells
   + epithelial stem cells
   + hematopoietic stem cells

## Inner cell mass of early embryos: embryonic stem (ES) cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508171321532.png" alt="image-20200508171321532" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Cells taken from the inner cell mass of an early mammalian embryo are embryonic stem (ES) cells.

ES cells cultured in suspension develop into embryoid bodies upon stimulation with the **transcription factor** <font color="EE0000">STAT3</font> (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)

### 1. ES cells and their pluripotency

![image-20200508171350975](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508171350975.png)

ES cells are derived from inner cell mass of early embryos

ES cells can be propagated in culture indefinitely in a pluripotent state. When transplanted back into a host early embryo, they can contribute cells to any tissue, including the germ line (germ cell).

How the pluripotency of ES cells Is maintained?
+ What are mechanisms underlying stemness, cell differentiation, and the stability of a differentiated state?

### 2. Identification of factors control/maintain the pluripotency of ES cells in animals

ES cells express high levels of active **telomerase (端粒酶)**, allowing them to escape senescence and continue dividing indefinitely. 

How the whole complex pattern of gene expression in an ES cell is organized and maintained that ensure its stemness, cell differentiation potential?

Gene expression analysis
+ → Identification of <font color="EE0000">Oct4</font> (octamer binding transcription factor 4)
+ **Oct4** is exclusively expressed in ES cells, in the germ-cell lineage and in the inner cell mass and its precursors. 
+ **Oct4** is a transcription regulator. 
+ Loss of **Oct4** in ES cells leads to <u>losing the ES cell character</u>
+ Loss of **Oct4** in an embryo, the precursors of inner cell mass are <u>diverted into an extraembryonic pathway of differentiation</u> and their <u>development is aborted.</u>

Multiple transcription regulators: <font color="EE0000">Oct4</font>, <font color="EE0000">Sox9</font>, <font color="EE0000">Nanog</font>…

### 3. Transcription network of ES cells

![image-20200508173828231](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508173828231.png)

Each of these transcription factors has been found to regulate over 1000 different genes.
+ **<font color="EE0000">OCT4</font>** (octamer binding transcription factor 4)
+ **<font color="EE0000">Sox2</font>** (sex determining region Y- box 2)
+ **<font color="EE0000">Nanog</font>** (Irish, Tír na nÓg , “land of eternal youth”)

The master regulators control their own expression. 

Many target genes are bound by more than one regulators.

#### OSKM/Yamanaka transcription factors and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508173848888.png" alt="image-20200508173848888" style="zoom:50%;" />

A total of 24 candidate ES-critical genes were tested to reprogram fibroblast to create **Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS)** 

By introducing four different transcription factors, <font color="EE0000">Kif4</font>, <font color="EE0000">Sox2</font>, <font color="EE0000">Oct4</font>, <font color="EE0000">c-myc</font> (they are also called <font color="EE0000">OSKM/Yamanaka transcription factors</font>).

+ Core set of transcription regulators, which, when co-expressed, could reprogram mouse fibroblasts, permanently converting them into cells closely similar to ES cells, ie. induced pluripotent stem cells

Master transcription factors
+ Self-induction
+ Regulate other genes, leading to changing patterns of
   + histone modification
   + DNA methylation (at early stage of development, a wide-spread DNA demethylation occurs)
   + Chromatin remodeling
   + miRNAs

#### Major events accompanying the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to iPS cells

![image-20200508174145282](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508174145282.png)

Biochemical analysis of iPS cells at different stages after transfection of <font color="EE0000">OSKM/Yamanaka transcription factors</font>.

#### Factors that have been observed to enhance reprogramming efficiency

+ 上图“尖角”朝上的表明enhance reprogramming， “尖角”朝下的表明inhibit

#### A strategy used to select cells that have converted to an iPS cell

![image-20200508174302565](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508174302565.png)

<font color="EE0000">Fbx15</font> is present in all cells but is normally expressed only in ES and early embryonic cells

## Using of stem cells

Cloning (via unfertilized egg): reproductive and therapeutic 

The use of embryonic stem cells to cure diseases such as diabetes.
+ Embryonic stem cells were induced to differentiate into pancreatic endoderm, which were then transplanted into mice.
+ These mice will produce functional **beta islet cells** to produce insulin.
+ Danger in introducing undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, because they will produce <u>tumor like mass</u>, containing large amounts of poorly differentiated cells

New tissue generation via iPS stem cells

![image-20200508174332968](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508174332968.png)

### 1. Cultured ES cells can give rise to a three-dimensional organ

![image-20200508174430573](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508174430573.png)

### 2. Medical applications for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200508174447666.png" alt="image-20200508174447666" style="zoom: 50%;" />

Two options to use iPS cells to cure the diseases.
+ Option 1: Use of iPS cells to produce a <u>patient-specific drug</u> to cure the disease
+ Option 2: Use of iPS cells to <u>repair a genetic defect</u> and to <u>regenerate patient-specific cells</u> for implantation
