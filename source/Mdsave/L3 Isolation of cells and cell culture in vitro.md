# 一、Isolation of cells

Isolated and cultivated cells are commonly used to study cell biology

![image-20200220143735252](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220143735252.png)

HeLa cells were the first immortalized human cell line (1951) 

Virtually all cells can be grown *in vitro* (几乎所有的细胞都可以在体外培养)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220143934345.png" alt="image-20200220143934345" style="zoom:80%;" />

> ? Animal cells must be cultured with adhesion, plant cells can be cultured in suspension.

## How to start a cell culture?

1. First you have to isolate <u>primary</u> cells from tissues

   > 直接从组织中分离出来的细胞叫做**元代细胞**（Primary Cell）

![image-20200220144037509](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220144037509.png)

```

Collagenase
```

If you are to isolate plant cells for cell cultures, **cellulase（纤维素酶）** and **macerozyme（核酶）** are used instead of **trypsin（胰蛋白酶）** and **collagenase（胶原酶）** to <u>digest the cell wall.</u>

## How to select specific cell types?

**Growth/cultivation** of single cell type that you are interested in. **→** Selection of specific cell types is necessary

**Physical selection** of the cells according to specific properties. 

+ <u>Fluorescence</u>-activated cell sorting (FACS)

+ <u>Immunoprecipitation</u> of whole cells using antibody against specific cell-surface proteins (called marker, e.g., CD19) which is conjugated with beads (polydextran（聚葡聚糖） or magnetic).
  + the <u>antibody</u> binds to a specific protein at the cell surface and thus attaches the whole cell to the bead.
  + The cells are then collected by “pull-down”. 

+ <u>Laser</u> capture microdissection
  + excision of cells using a laser beam

## Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220145419499.png" alt="image-20200220145419499" style="zoom:80%;" />

Prerequisite for sorting is the presence of a fluorescent marker in the cells (e.g. fluorescent dye or fluorescence-conjugated antibody)

Cells are guided by the **sheath fluid** into the center of the stream to get into the drops (1 cell/drop)

Detection of fluorescence (laser/analyzer)

Drops are electrically charged based on the result of analysis of fluorescence.

Sorting occurs then via deflection of the drop with the cell in an <u>electrical field</u> in different collection tubes

> (Labeled cells can be negatively charged, non-labeled cells are positively charged)

## Magnetic beads (immunoprecipitation)

Cell sorting via <u>immunoprecipitation</u> using “magnetic beads”

**Two** strategies: <u>positive</u> isolation of cells and <u>negative</u> isolation of cells.

+ <u>Positive isolation</u>: Immobilize the cells you want ![image-20200220145814992](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220145814992.png) and remove all other cells

  目标提取细胞可以被beads识别

![image-20200220145822530](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220145822530.png)



+ <u>Negative isolation</u>: Immobilize the cells you want ![image-20200220145814992](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220145814992.png) and remove all other cells
+ 目标提取细胞是不被beads识别的细胞
+ Advantages: 目标提取的细胞没有被beads识别，因此保持了Natural property

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220145921201.png" alt="image-20200220145921201" style="zoom:80%;" />

Example: Isolation of T cells from thymus:

+ Homogenize thymus tissue
+ Add CD3-conjugated magnetic beads
+ Immobilize cells by magnetic force
+ Wash immobilized cells
+ Mission accomplished!

<u>Advantage: The cells you want to isolate remain “untouched”!</u>

## Laser capture microdissection

![image-20200220150113342](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150113342.png)

# 二、Cell culture

## Growth & maintenance of cells *in vitro*

### 1. A basic cell culture media for mammalian cells usually contains: 

1. <u>Buffer substance</u> for pH regulation. Maintain Ph stability.
2. <u>Food source</u> (e.g. glucose, glutamine, amino acids, nucleotides, etc.)
3. <u>Serum（血清）/growth stimulant</u> (Some cells grows depends on growth factor)
4. <u>Minerals</u> for metabolic functioning of the cells
5. <u>Antibiotic</u> additives and <u>pH indicator</u> (Not necessary, cause the culture environment should be bacteria-free )

### 2. A basic cell culture media for plant cells usually contains

1. <u>Buffer substance</u> for pH regulation
2. <u>Nitrogen source</u> (e.g. NH4NO3)
3. <u>Minerals</u> for metabolic functioning of the cells

### 3. Some commonly used media For Animal Cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150344930.png" alt="image-20200220150344930" style="zoom:67%;" />

1. Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM)
2. RPMI-1640
3. McCoy’s 5A
4. F12, etc.

### 4. Commonly used media for plant cells

Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium in different concentrations:

+ MS is perfect for most plants
+ ½ strength is perfect for orchids
+ some cell cultures like up to 2% sucrose

<u>Plant medium is cheap</u>

## Immortalization of a cell line

Immortalized cells are a population of cells which can escape normal <u>cellular senescence (细胞衰老)</u> and <u>keep undergoing division</u>. Thus, this kind of cells can grow in vitro for prolonged periods. This usually is due to some carcinogenic mutations. 

Strategies to immortalization cells:

1. **Virus** to transform the cells, example is SV40:

   <img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150932516.png" alt="image-20200220150932516" style="zoom: 80%;" />

2. **Special Genes**, example: hTERT: 

![image-20200220150940787](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150940787.png)

### 1. Commonly used cell lines

![image-20200220150641811](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150641811.png)

### 2. Authenticated Cell lines can be obtained from stock centers

ATCC Mission: To acquire, authenticate, preserve, develop, standardize, and distribute biological materials and information for the advancement and application of scientific knowledge.

![image-20200220150900786](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150900786.png)

ATCC serves by characterizing cell lines, bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. 

+ 4,000 human and animal cell lines and 1,200 hybridoma. 
+ 18,000 strains of bacteria from 900 genera.
+ 2,000 different types of animal viruses and 1,000 plant viruses.
+ 49,000 yeast and fungi strains from 1,500 genera and 2,000 strains of protists. 

![image-20200220150906416](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150906416.png)

### 3. Generation of a “new” cell line by fusion of different cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220150959938.png" alt="image-20200220150959938" style="zoom: 120%;" />

```
By adding membrane fusing agent
Heterocaryon：异核体
Hybridoma cells: 杂种细胞
```

Hybridoma cells: fusion of a <u>differentiated</u> cell with a **tumor** cell

Different types of cells can be <u>fused together</u> to display properties from the two sides…

<u>Fusion with a tumor cell line results in immortal cells (immortalization)…</u>

### 4. Hybridoma cells produce monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma cells

Generate <u>antibody-secreting B lymphocytes</u> by immunization of a mouse and fuse these cells with **B lymphocyte tumor cells** to generate a hybridoma line, an immortal, antibody-secreting cell line!!!

<u>Form hybridoma:</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220151112745.png" alt="image-20200220151112745" style="zoom:80%;" />

Next, <u>screen the individual hybridoma</u> to get the line that produces the best antibody…

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220151130445.png" alt="image-20200220151130445" style="zoom: 80%;" />

<u>All commercially available monoclonal antibodies are produced in hybridoma cells…</u>

# 三、2D and 3D culture

3-D cell culture might reflect the *in vivo* condition more accurately. 

In the *in vivo* situation, cells are *embedded* in the <u>extracellular matrix (ECM)</u>, which are known to have effects on various essential cellular activities. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220151540381.png" alt="image-20200220151540381" style="zoom:80%;" />

3D culture mimic the *in vivo* environment. (Animal cells cannot be cultured in suspension) 

## Cell shape determined by the structure and composition of the ECM

(Fibroblasts produce the ECM proteins and maintain the ECM environment)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200220151645262.png" alt="image-20200220151645262" style="zoom:80%;" />

```
Culture with or without laminin(层粘连蛋白) (ECM)
```
