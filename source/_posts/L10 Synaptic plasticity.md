# 一、Synaptic plasticity

Synaptic connections between neurons provide the basic “wiring"' of the brain's  circuitry

The strength of synaptic connectivity between neurons is a dynamic entity that is  constantly changing in response to neural activity and other influences. 

Such changes in synaptic transmission arise from several forms of plasticity that  vary in time scale from milliseconds to years.

## Short-term synaptic plasticity

**Short-term synaptic plasticity**:

+ Most short-term forms of synaptic plasticity <u>affect the amount of neurotransmitter</u> released from presynaptic terminals in response to a presynaptic action potential.
+ Several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity--including facilitation, augmentation, and  potentiation--<u>enhance neurotransmitter release</u> and are caused by persistent actions of  calcium ions within the presynaptic terminal.
+ Another form of short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, <u>decreases the amount of  neurotransmitter</u> released and appears to be due to an activity-dependent depletion of  synaptic vesicles that are ready to undergo exocytosis.

Chemical synapses are capable of undergoing plastic changes that either  strengthen or weaken synaptic transmission.

The short-term forms of plasticity--those lasting for a few minutes or less--are  readily observed during repeated activation of any chemical synapse.

There are several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity that differ in their time  courses and their underlying mechanisms

## Long-term synaptic plasticity

**Long-term synaptic plasticity:**

+ Long-term forms of synaptic plasticity alter synaptic transmission over time scales of 30  minutes or longer.
+ Examples of such long-lasting plasticity include **long-term potentiation and long-term  depression**
+ These long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity arise from molecular mechanisms that  vary over time:
  + The initial changes in synaptic transmission arise from <u>posttranslational modifications</u> of existing  proteins, most notably changes in the <u>trafficking</u> of glutamate receptors.
  + The later phases of synaptic modification result from <u>changes in gene expression and synthesis of  new proteins</u>
    + These changes produce enduring changes in synaptic transmission, including synapse growth, that can  yield essentially permanent modifications of brain function.

# 二、Effect of Synaptic Plasticity

## Synaptic facilitation

**Synaptic facilitation** is a rapid increase in synaptic strength that occurs when two  or more action potentials invade the presynaptic terminal within a few  milliseconds of each other.

Many lines of evidence indicate that facilitation is the result of prolonged  elevation of presynaptic calcium levels following synaptic activity.

+ Although the entry of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal occurs within 1 to 2  milliseconds after an action potential invades, the mechanisms that return Ca2+ to  resting levels are much slower.
+ Thus, when action potentials arrive close together in  time, calcium builds up within the terminal and allows  more neurotransmitters to be released by a  subsequent presynaptic action potential
+ Recent evidence indicates that the target of this  residual Ca2+ signal is synaptotagmin 7, a Ca2+binding protein that is found on the plasma  membrane and is related to the synaptotagmins that are present on synaptic vesicles and serve as  Ca2+ sensors for triggering neurotransmitter  release.

## Synaptic depression

Opposing facilitation is **synaptic depression**, which causes neurotransmitter  release to decline during sustained synaptic activity

An important clue to the cause of synaptic depression comes from observations  that depression depends on the amount of neurotransmitter that has been  released

For example, lowering the external Ca2+ concentration, to reduce the number of  quanta released by each presynaptic action potential, causes the rate of  depression to be slowed.

Depression is caused by progressive depletion of a pool of synaptic vesicles that  are available for release:

+ when rates of release are high, these vesicles deplete rapidly and cause a lot of  depression;
+ depletion slows as the rate of release is reduced, yielding less depression.

## Synaptic potentiation and augmentation

Other forms of synaptic plasticity, such as **synaptic potentiation** and  **augmentation**, also are elicited by repeated synaptic activity and serve to increase  the amount of transmitter released from presynaptic terminals.

Both augmentation and potentiation enhance the ability of incoming Ca2+ to  trigger fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, but the two  processes work over different time scales.

+ <u>Augmentation</u> rises and falls over a few seconds.
+ <u>Potentiation</u> acts over a time scale of tens of seconds to minutes.

Although both augmentation and potentiation are thought to arise from  prolonged elevation of presynaptic calcium levels during synaptic activity, the  mechanisms responsible for these forms of plasticity are poorly understood.

+ It has been proposed that augmentation results from Ca2+ enhancing the  actions of the presynaptic SNARE-regulatory protein munc-13
+ while potentiation may arise when Ca2+ activates presynaptic protein kinases  that go on to phosphorylate substrates (such as synapsin) that regulate  transmitter release.

During repetitive synaptic activity, these forms of short-term plasticity can interact  to cause synaptic transmission to change in complex ways.

# 三、Synaptic plasticity in *Aplysia*

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606155842513.png" alt="image-20210606155842513" style="zoom:67%;" />

**Eric Kandel** (2000 Nobel Prize) and his colleagues at Columbia University have  used the marine mollusk Aplysia californica to study synaptic plasticity.

+ This sea slug has only a few tens of thousands of neurons, many of which are quite large  (up to 1 mm in diameter) and in stereotyped locations within the ganglia that make up  the animal's nervous system.
+ These attributes make it practical to monitor the electrical activity of specific,identifiable nerve cells, and thus to define the synaptic circuits involved in mediating the limited behavioral repertoire of *Aplysia*.
+ *Aplysia* exhibit several elementary forms of behavioral plasticity.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606155848263.png" alt="image-20210606155848263" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Habituation

**Habituation** is a process that causes the animal to become less responsive to  repeated occurrences of a stimulus.

+ Habituation is found in many other species, including humans.
+ Habituation in humans?
+ A light touch to the siphon of an Aplysia results in withdrawal of the animal's gill, but  habituation causes the gill withdrawal to become weaker during repeated stimulation of  the siphon

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606155931430.png" alt="image-20210606155931430" style="zoom:80%;" />

## Sensitization

The gill-withdrawal response of Aplysia exhibits another form of plasticity called  **sensitization**.

+ Sensitization is a process that allows an animal to generalize an aversive response  elicited by a noxious stimulus to a variety of other, non-noxious stimuli.
+ In *Aplysia* that have habituated to siphon touching, sensitization of gill withdrawal is elicited by pairing a strong electrical stimulus to the animal's tail with another light touch of the siphon.
+ This pairing causes the siphon stimulus to again elicit a strong withdrawal of the gill  because the noxious stimulus to the tail sensitizes the gill-withdrawal reflex to light  touch.

![image-20210606160034817](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606160034817.png)

Even after a single stimulus to the tail, the gill-withdrawal reflex remains enhanced for at  least an hour, which can be viewed as a simple form of short-term memory.

With repeated pairing of tail and siphon stimuli, this behavior can be altered for days or  weeks, also demonstrating a simple form of long-term memory.

![image-20210606160057303](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606160057303.png)

## Synaptic mechanisms in *Aplysia*

The small number of neurons in the Aplysia nervous system makes it possible to  define the synaptic circuits involved in gill withdrawal and to monitor the activity  of individual neurons in these circuits:

+ Mechanosensory neurons that innervate the siphon
+ Motor neurons that innervate muscles in the gill
+ Interneurons that receive inputs from a variety of sensory neurons.

Touching the siphon activates the mechanosensory neurons, which form  excitatory synapses that release glutamate onto both the interneurons and the  motor neurons.

The interneurons form excitatory synapses on motor neurons

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606160312770.png" alt="image-20210606160312770" style="zoom:80%;" />

When the motor neurons are  activated by the summed synaptic  excitation of the sensory neurons  and interneurons, they release  acetylcholine that excites the  muscle cells of the gill, producing  gill withdrawal.

## Synaptic mechanisms underlying  short-term sensitization

Both habituation and sensitization appear to arise from plastic changes in synaptic  transmission in this circuit.

During habituation, transmission at the glutamatergic synapse between the  sensory and motor neurons is depressed.

This synaptic depression is thought to be responsible for the decreasing ability of  siphon stimuli to evoke gill contractions during habituation

This depression is presynaptic and is due to a reduction in the number of synaptic  vesicles available for release.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606160400729.png" alt="image-20210606160400729" style="zoom:80%;" />

Sensitization modifies the function of this circuit by recruiting additional neurons.

The tail shock that evokes sensitization activates sensory neurons that innervate  the tail

These sensory neurons in turn excite modulatory interneurons that release  serotonin onto the presynaptic terminals of the sensory neurons of the siphon.

Serotonin enhances transmitter release from the siphon sensory neuron terminals,  leading to increased synaptic excitation of the motor neurons.

![image-20210606160425291](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606160425291.png)

This modulation of the sensory neuron-motor neuron synapse lasts approximately  an hour

This is similar to the duration of the short-term sensitization of gill withdrawal  produced by applying a single stimulus to the tail.

Thus, the short-term sensitization apparently is due to recruitment of additional  synaptic elements, namely the modulatory interneurons that strengthen synaptic  transmission in the gill withdrawal circuit.

![image-20210606161102068](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161102068.png)

## Mechanism of presynaptic enhancement  underlying short-term sensitization

![image-20210606161107611](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161107611.png)

1. Serotonin released by the modulatory interneurons binds to G-protein-coupled receptors on  the presynaptic terminals of the siphon sensory neurons
2. This stimulates production of the second messenger, cAMP.
3. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A.
4. This liberate catalytic subunits of PKA that are then able to phosphorylate several proteins,  probably including K+ channels
   + The net effect of the action of PKA is to  reduce the probability that the K+ channels  open during a presynaptic action potential.
5. This effect prolongs the presynaptic  action potential, thereby opening more  presynaptic Ca2+ channels.
6. The enhanced influx of Ca2+ into the  presynaptic terminals increases the  amount of transmitter released onto  motor neurons during a sensory neuron  action potential

In summary, a signal transduction cascade that involves neurotransmitters, second  messengers, protein kinases, and ion channels mediates short-term sensitization  of gill withdrawal.

This cascade ultimately causes a short-term enhancement of synaptic  transmission between the sensory and motor neurons within the gill withdrawal  circuit.

## Mechanism of presynaptic enhancement  underlying long-term sensitization

![image-20210606161157742](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161157742.png)

The same serotonin-induced enhancement of glutamate release that mediates  short-term sensitization is also thought to underlie long-term sensitization.

The prolonged duration of this form of plasticity is evidently due to changes in  gene expression and thus protein synthesis.

With repeated training (i.e., additional tail shocks), the serotonin-activated PKA  involved in short-term sensitization now also phosphorylates--and thereby  activates--the transcriptional activator CREB.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161213710.png" alt="image-20210606161213710" style="zoom: 67%;" />

![image-20210606161157742](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161157742.png)

1. CREB stimulates the synthesis of an enzyme, ubiquitin hydroxylase, that stimulates  degradation of the regulatory subunit of PKA.
   + This causes a persistent increase in the amount of free catalytic subunit, meaning that some  PKA is persistently active and no longer requires serotonin to be activated.
2. CREB also stimulates another transcriptional activator protein called C/EBP. 
   + C/EBP stimulates transcription of other, unknown genes that cause addition of synaptic  terminals, yielding a long-term increase in the number of synapses between the sensory and  the motor neurons.

Another protein involved in the long-term synaptic facilitation is a cytoplasmic  polyadenylation element binding protein, CPEB.

+ CPEB activates mRNAs and may be important for local control of protein synthesis.
+ CPEB has self-sustaining properties like those of prion proteins, which could allow CPEB  to remain active in perpetuity and thereby mediate permanent changes in synaptic  structure.

# 四、Synaptic plasticity in invertebrates

These studies of Aplysia and related work on other invertebrates, such as the fruit  fly, have led to several generalizations about synaptic plasticity

+ Synaptic plasticity clearly can lead to changes in circuit function and, ultimately, to  behavioral plasticity
+ These plastic changes in synaptic function can be either short-term effects that rely on  posttranslational modification of existing synaptic proteins, or they can be long-term  changes that require changes in gene expression, new protein synthesis, and growth of  new synapses (or the elimination of existing ones).

## Long-term synaptic plasticity in mammals

Long-term synaptic plasticity has also been identified within the  mammalian brain:

1. Some patterns of synaptic activity produce a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength known as **long-term potentiation** (**LTP**).
2. Other patterns of activity produce a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength,known as **long-term depression** (**LTD**).

LTP and LTD are produced by different histories of activity and are  mediated by different complements of intracellular signal transduction  pathways in the nerve cells involved.

## Long-term potentiation at a hippocampal synapse

Long-term synaptic plasticity has been most thoroughly studied at  excitatory synapses in the mammalian hippocampus.

The hippocampus is especially important in the formation and/or retrieval  of some forms of memory

+ In humans, functional imaging shows that the hippocampus is activated during  certain kinds of memory tasks and that damage to this brain region results in an  inability to form certain types of new memories.
+ In rodents, certain hippocampal neurons fire action potentials only when an  animal is in certain locations.
  + Such “place cells” (John O'Keefe, 2014 Nobel Prize) appear to encode spatial  memories, an interpretation supported by the fact that hippocampal damage  prevents rats from developing proficiency in spatial learning tasks.

Work on LTP began in the late 1960s, when Terje Lomo and Timothy Bliss,  working in the laboratory of Per Andersen in Oslo, Norway, discovered that  a few seconds of high-frequency electrical stimulation can enhance  synaptic transmission in the rabbit hippocampus for days or even weeks

More recently, however, progress in understanding the mechanism of LTP  has relied heavily on in vitro studies of slices of Iiving hippocampus.

## Trisynaptic circuit of hippocampus

The arrangement of neurons allows the hippocampus to be sectioned such  that most of the relevant circuitry is left intact.

In such preparations, the cell bodies of the pyramidal neurons lie in a  single densely packed layer that is readily apparent.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161611776.png" alt="image-20210606161611776" style="zoom: 67%;" />

+ This layer is divided into several distinct  regions, the major ones being CA1 and  CA3.
  + “CA” refers to cornu Ammonis, Latin for  Ammon’s horn--the ram’s horn that  resembles the shape of the hippocampus
  + The dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA1  region form a thick band (the stratum  radiatum), where they receive synapses  from Schaffer collaterals, the axons of  pyramidal cells in the CA3 region.

### 1. Long-term potentiation of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses

Much of the work on LTP has focused on the synaptic connections between  the Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cells.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161711385.png" alt="image-20210606161711385" style="zoom:50%;" />

Electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals generates excitatory  postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the postsynaptic CA1 cells .

+ If the Schaffer collaterals are stimulated only two or three times per minute,  the size of the evoked EPSP in the CA1 neurons remains constant.
+ However, a brief, high-frequency train of  stimuli to the same axons causes LTP, which is evident as a long-lasting increase in EPSP  amplitude.
+ While the maximum duration of LTP is not  known, LTP can last for more than a year in  some cases.

![image-20210606161728471](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161728471.png)

### 2. Properties of LTP in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606161918293.png" alt="image-20210606161918293" style="zoom: 67%;" />

LTP of the Schaffer collateral synapse exhibits several properties that make  it an attractive neural mechanism for information storage

1. LTP requires strong activity in both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.
   + If action potentials in a small number of presynaptic  Schaffer collaterals--which evokes transmitter  release that produces subthreshold EPSPs that  would not normally yield LTP--are paired with strong depolarization of the postsynaptic CA1 cell,  the activated Schaffer collateral synapses undergo  LTP
   + This increase in synaptic transmission occurs only if  the paired activities of the presynaptic and  postsynaptic cells are tightly linked in time, such  that the strong postsynaptic depolarization occurs  within about 100 ms of transmitter release from the  Schaffer collaterals.
   + This indicates that the involvement of a **coincidence** **detector** that allows LTP to occur only when both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are active
2. LTP is input specific: When LTP is induced by activation of one synapse, it does  not occur in other, inactive synapses that contact the same neuron.
   + LTP is restricted to activated synapses rather than to all of the synapses on a given cell
3. Associativity
   + Weak stimulation of a pathway will not by itself trigger LTP
   + If one pathway is weakly activated at the same time that a neighboring pathway onto  the same cell is strongly activated, both synaptic pathways undergo LTP.
   + This selective  enhancement of  conjointly activated  sets of synaptic  inputs is often  considered a cellular  analog of associative  learning, where two  stimuli are required  for learning to take  place.

![image-20210606162041050](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606162041050.png)

## Mechanisms underlying LTP

The NMDA receptor channel is permeable to Ca2+ , but is blocked by Mg2+.

This property provides a critical insight into how LTP is selectively induced  by high-frequency activity

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606162947070.png" alt="image-20210606162947070" style="zoom: 67%;" />

+ During low-frequency synaptic  transmission, glutamate released by the  Schaffer collaterals binds to both NMDAtype and AMPA/kainate-type glutamate  receptors.
+ While both types of receptors bind  glutamate, if the postsynaptic neuron is at  its normal resting membrane potential, the  pore of the NMDA receptor channel will be  blocked by Mg2+ ions and no current will  flow
+ Under such conditions, the EPSP will be  mediated entirely by the AMPA receptors.

Because blockade of the NMDA receptor by Mg2+ is voltage-dependent, the  function of the synapse changes when the postsynaptic cell is depolarized.

High-frequency stimulation will cause summation of EPSPs, leading to a  prolonged depolarization that expels Mg2+ from the NMDA channel pore.

Removal of Mg2+ allows Ca2+ to enter the postsynaptic neuron, and the  resulting increase in Ca2+ concentration within the dendritic spines of the  postsynaptic cell turns out to be the trigger for LTP.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606163022868.png" alt="image-20210606163022868" style="zoom:50%;" />

The NMDA receptor thus behaves like a  molecular **coincidence detector**: The channel  of this receptor opens (to induce LTP) only  when two events occur simultaneously:  glutamate is bound to the receptor, and the  postsynaptic cell is depolarized to relieve the  Mg2+ block of the channel pore.

These properties of the NMDA receptor can account for many of the  characteristics of LTP:

+ The requirement for strong <u>coincident</u> presynaptic and postsynaptic activity to  induce LTP arises because presynaptic activity releases glutamate, while the  coincident postsynaptic depolarization relieves the Mg2+ block of the NMDA  receptor.
+ The <u>specificity</u> of LTP can be explained by the fact that NMDA channels will be  opened only at synaptic inputs that are active and releasing glutamate,  thereby confining LTP to these sites even though EPSPs generated at active  synapses depolarize the postsynaptic neuron
+ With respect to <u>associativity</u>, a weakly stimulated input releases glutamate but  cannot sufficiently depolarize the postsynaptic cell to relieve the Mg2+ block.
  + If neighboring inputs are strongly stimulated, they provide the "associative"  depolarization necessary to relieve the block.

Several sorts of observations have confirmed that a rise in the  concentration of Ca2+ in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron--the result of Ca2+  entering through NMDA receptors--serves as a second messenger signal  that induces LTP

+ Imaging studies have shown that activation of NMDA receptors causes  increases in postsynaptic Ca2+ levels
+ Injection of Ca2+ chelators blocks LTP induction, whereas elevation of Ca2+ levels  in postsynaptic neurons potentiates synaptic transmission.
+ In the postsynaptic neuron, Ca2+ induces LTP by activating complicated signal  transduction cascades that include at least two Ca2+-activated protein kinases:  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC).
  + CaMKII is activated  during stimuli that  induce LTP, and  pharmacological  inhibition or genetic  deletion of CaMKII prevents LTP.

![image-20210606163520893](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606163520893.png)

The strengthening of synaptic transmission during LTP arises from an  increase in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic cell to glutamate.

Excitatory synapses can dynamically regulate their postsynaptic glutamate  receptors and can even add <u>new AMPA receptors</u> to “silent” synapses that  did not previously have postsynaptic AMPA receptors.

+ The “expression” or maintenance of LTP apparently is due to such insertion of  AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane (as opposed to "induction“ of  LTP, which relies on activation of NMDA receptors).
+ The resulting increase in the density of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic  spine increases the response of the postsynaptic cell to released glutamate,  yielding a strengthening of synaptic transmission that can last for as long as LTP  is maintained.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606163641612.png" alt="image-20210606163641612" style="zoom: 67%;" />

![image-20210606163647724](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606163647724.png)

Summary for the molecular signaling pathways involved in LTP at the  Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse:

+ During glutamate release, the NMDA channel opens only if the postsynaptic cell  is sufficiently depolarized.
+ The Ca2+ ions that enter the cell through the channel activate postsynaptic  protein kinases such as CaMKII and PKC.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606163709110.png" alt="image-20210606163709110" style="zoom: 67%;" />

These postsynaptic kinases trigger a series of  reactions that lead to insertion of new AMPA  receptors into the postsynaptic spine and an  increase in the spine's sensitivity to glutamate.

Under some circumstances, LTP also can  increase the ability of presynaptic terminals  to release glutamate.

Because LTP clearly is triggered by the  actions of Ca2+ within the postsynaptic  neuron, this potentiation of presynaptic  function requires the spread of a retrograde  signal (perhaps NO) from the postsynaptic  spine back to the presynaptic terminals

## Mechanisms underlying a later phase of LTP

There is also a later phase of LTP that depends on changes in gene  expression and the synthesis of new proteins.

The contributions of this late phase can be observed by treating synapses  with drugs that inhibit protein synthesis:

+ Repetitive high-frequency stimulation induces LTP that persists for many hours
+ Treatment with anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, causes LTP to  decay within a few hours after the high-frequency stimulation.

This late phase of LTP appears to be initiated by protein kinase A, which  goes on to activate transcription factors such as CREB, which stimulate the  expression of other proteins

Although most of these newly synthesized proteins have not yet been  identified, they include other transcriptional regulators, protein kinases,  and AMPA receptors.

There is evidence that the number and size of synaptic contacts increases  during LTP.

It is likely that some of the proteins newly synthesized during the late  phase of LTP are involved in construction of new synaptic contacts that  serve to make LTP essentially permanent

## LTP in *Aplysia* and mammalian hippocampus

Both consist of an early, transient phase that relies on protein kinases to  produce posttranslational changes in membrane channels.

Both have later, long-lasting phases that require changes in gene  expression mediated by CREB

Both forms of long-term synaptic plasticity are likely to be involved in long-term storage of information, although the role of LTP in memory storage in  the hippocampus is not firmly established.

## Mechanisms underlying LTD

LTD was found to occur at the synapses between the Schaffer collaterals  and the CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus in the late 1970s.

LTP at these synapses requires brief, high-frequency stimulation

LTD occurs when the Schaffer collaterals are stimulated at a low rate-about 1 Hz--for long periods (10-15 minutes).

This pattern of activity depresses  the EPSP for several hours and,  like LTP, is specific to the activated  synapses.

LTD can erase the increase in EPSP  size due to LTP, and, conversely, LTP  can erase the decrease in EPSP size  due to LTD

This complementarity suggests that  LTD and LTP reversibly affect  synaptic efficiency by acting at a  common site.

## Key elements shared by LTP and LTD

Both require activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and the  resulting entry of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell.

The major determinant of whether LTP or LTD arises appears to be the  nature of the Ca2+ signal in the postsynaptic cell:

+ Small and slow rises in Ca2+ lead to depression.
+ Large and fast increases in Ca2+ trigger potentiation.

Modification of target proteins in LTP and LTD:

+ LTP is at least partially due to activation of protein kinases, which  phosphorylate their target proteins
+ LTD, on the other hand, appears to result from activation of Ca2+-dependent  phosphatases that cleave phosphate groups from these target molecules.
  + Evidence in support of this idea is that phosphatase inhibitors prevent LTD, but do not  block LTP

The different effects of Ca2+ during LTD and LTP may arise from the  selective activation of protein phosphatases and kinases by the different  types of Ca2+ signals.

It is possible that LTP and LTD phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the  same set of regulatory proteins to control the efficacy of transmission at  the Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapse.

Just as LTP at this synapse is associated with insertion of AMPA receptors,  LTD is often associated with a loss of synaptic AMPA receptors.

This loss probably arises from  internalization of AMPA receptors  into the postsynaptic cell, due to  the same sort of clathrindependent endocytosis  mechanisms important for synaptic  vesicle recycling in the presynaptic  terminal.

## LTD in the cerebellum

LTD of synaptic inputs onto cerebellar Purkinje cells was first described by  Masao Ito and his colleagues in Japan in the early 1980s.

Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum receive two distinct types of excitatory  input: climbing fibers and parallel fibers.

LTD reduces the strength of transmission at the parallel fiber synapse and  has recently been found to depress transmission at the climbing fiber  synapse as well.

This form of LTD has been implicated in the  motor learning that mediates the  coordination, acquisition, and storage of  complex movements within the cerebellum.

Cerebellar LTD is associative because it  occurs only when climbing fibers and  parallel fibers are activated at the same  time

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606164815772.png" alt="image-20210606164815772" style="zoom:67%;" />

Associativity arises from the combined  actions of two distinct intracellular  signal transduction pathways that are  activated in the postsynaptic Purkinje  cell due to the activity of climbing fiber  and parallel fiber synapses.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Neurobiology/image-20210606164823365.png" alt="image-20210606164823365" style="zoom:67%;" />

1. Glutamate released from the parallel  fiber terminals activates at two types of  receptors, the AMPA-type and  metabotropic glutamate receptors
   1. Glutamate binding to the AMPA receptor  results in membrane depolarization,  whereas binding to the metabotropic  receptor produces the second messengers  inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and  diacylglycerol (DAG)
2. The second signal transduction pathway, initiated by climbing fiber activation,  causes an influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated channels and a subsequent  increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
   + These second messengers work together to cause an amplified rise in  intracellular Ca2+ concentration, due to IP3 and Ca2+ acting together on IP3  receptors, triggering release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and the synergistic  activation of PKC by Ca2+ and DAG.
   + The associative property of cerebellar LTD  appears to arise from both IP3 receptors  and PKC serving as coincidence detectors.
   + AMPA receptors are one of the proteins  phosphorylated by PKC
   + The consequence of PKC activation is to  cause an internalization of AMPA receptors  via clathrin-dependent endocytosis.
   + This loss of AMPA receptors decreases the  response of the post synaptic Purkinje cell  to glutamate released from the  presynaptic terminals of the parallel fibers.

## LTD in the cerebellum and hippocampus

In contrast to LTD in the hippocampus, cerebellar LTD requires the activity  of a protein kinase, rather than a phosphatase, and does not involve Ca2+  entry through the NMDA type of glutamate receptor (which is not present  in mature Purkinje cells).

However, the net effect is the same in both cases: internalization of AMPA  receptors is a common mechanism for decreased efficacy of both  hippocampal and cerebellar synapses during LTD

# Summary for synaptic plasticity

Synapses exhibit many forms of plasticity that occur over a broad temporal  range.

<u>At the shortest times (seconds to minutes)</u>, facilitation, augmentation,  potentiation, and depression provide rapid but transient modifications in  synaptic transmission.

+ These forms of plasticity change the amount of neurotransmitter released  from presynaptic terminals and are based on alterations in Ca2+ signaling and  synaptic vesicle pools at recently active terminals.

<u>Longer-lasting form</u>s of synaptic plasticity such as LTP and LTD are also  based on Ca2+ and other intracellular second messengers.

+ At least some of the synaptic changes produced by these long-lasting forms of  plasticity are postsynaptic, caused by changes in neurotransmitter receptor  trafficking, although alterations in neurotransmitter release from the  presynaptic terminal can also occur.
+ In these more enduring forms of plasticity, protein phosphorylation and  changes in gene expression greatly outlast the period of synaptic activity and  can yield changes in synaptic strength that persist for hours, days, or even  longer
