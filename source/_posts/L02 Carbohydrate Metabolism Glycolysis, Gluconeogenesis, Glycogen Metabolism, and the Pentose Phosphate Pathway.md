## Two Phases of Glycolysis

**The two phases of glycolysis and the products of glycolysis:**

1. Energy Investment Phase
2. Energy Generation Phase

Glycolysis is an ancient metabolic pathway (evolved before the earliest known photosynthetic organisms began contributing O~2~ to the earth’s atmosphere. 

Glycolysis is the first metabolic pathway!

In animal cells, pyruvate's fate:

1. acetyl-CoA, citric acid cycle (aerobic glycolysis)
2. lactate（乳酸）

## Fermentation

### 1. Homolactic Fermentation

A **fermentation (发酵)** is an <u>energy-yielding metabolic pathway</u> with <u>no net change in the oxidation state</u> of products compared to substrates.

Anaerobic glycolysis (like aerobic glycolysis) leads to <u>pyruvate</u>, <u>but the pyruvate is then reduced</u>, so no net oxidation of glucose occurs.

![image-20200218205546885](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218205546885.png)

```
Homolactic Ferentation: 乳酸发酵
ΔG°': 标准状态下，1mol 反应物产生的能量
```

Louis Pasteur： fermentations are carried out by microorganisms (in 1856)-a milestone in the history of science!

Later (in 1897) two other scientists: fermentation occurs under cell-free condition-leading to discovery of enzyme; 
$$
\text{pyruvate + NADH + H}^{+} \rarr \text{L-Lactate + NAD}^{+} 
$$


### 2. Alcoholic Fermentation

**Alcoholic fermentation（酒精发酵）** involves cleavage of <u>pyruvate to acetaldehyde</u> and CO2 with the acetaldehyde then <u>reduced</u> to <u>ethanol</u> by <u>alcohol dehydrogenase</u>（乙醇脱氢酶）:

### 3. Summarize to Fermentation

<u>Fermentations use a common strategy to regenerate oxidized NAD+.</u>

<u>No net change in the oxidation state in all fermentation！</u> 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218205658255.png" alt="image-20200218205658255" style="zoom:150%;" />

# 二、Reactions of Glycolysis

**The chemical strategy of glycolysis can be condensed into three processes:**
**(10 Steps)**

1. <u>Add phosphoryl groups to glucose</u>, yielding compounds with <u>low</u> phosphate group–transfer potential = <u>priming (底料，装填物)</u>.
2. Chemically <u>convert</u> these <u>low</u> phosphate group–transfer potential intermediates into compounds with <u>high</u> phosphate group–transfer potential.
3. Chemically couple the energy–yielding <u>hydrolysis</u> of these high phosphate group–transfer potential compounds to the synthesis of <u>ATP</u> by transfer of the phosphate group to ADP.

## Three Routes to Synthesize ATP

**ATP is synthesized by three major routes:**

+ Substrate-level phosphorylation 底物水平的磷酸化

  <u>Direct transfer of a phosphoryl  group from a donor compound to ADP, yielding ATP</u>

+ Oxidative phosphorylation 氧化磷酸化（机体内形成ATP的主要方法）

  <u>**Indirect** synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase driven by  the proton gradient cross the mitochondrial inner membrane.</u>

+ Photophosphorylation 光磷酸化（植物、藻类形成ATP的主要方法）

  <u>The utilization of photosynthetic light energy to generate a proton gradient and ATP in plants and some microorganisms</u>

  Glycolysis produces ATP via **substrate-level phosphorylation**

**An overview of glycolysis:** 

This condensed view of glycolysis shows the <u>key intermediates</u> and reactions in each of the two major phases. 

In the energy-generating phase, two ATPs are produced for each ATP utilized in the energy-investment phase.

## First 5 Reactions: Energy Investment Phase

The first five reactions constitute the energy-investment phase of glycolysis.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210011236.png" alt="image-20200218210011236" style="zoom: 80%;" />

```
DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate 二羟丙酮磷酸
GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 甘油醛-3-磷酸
Hexokinase: 己糖激酶
```

### 1. Reaction 1: The First ATP Investment

glycolysis begins with the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, catalyzed by **hexokinase**.(己糖激酶)

![image-20200218210120272](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210120272.png)

```
需要Mg2+提供反应活性
```

<u>Mammals</u> possess several molecular forms of **hexokinase** .

Different molecular forms of an enzyme catalyzing the same reaction are called **isoenzymes**, **isozymes（同工酶）**, or isoforms. 

Most tissues express <u>hexokinase I, II, or III</u>, all <u>low K~M~ enzymes.</u> （对底物的亲和力较高）

Because <u>intracellular glucose levels (2–15 mM)</u> are usually far higher than the K~M~ value for hexokinase, the enzyme often functions in vivo at <u>saturating</u> substrate concentrations.

A low affinity isozyme of <u>hexokinase IV in liver</u> with a sigmoidal dependence on glucose concentration permits that organ to adjust glucose utilization to glucose supply <u>at high blood glucose levels</u>.

<u>Liver plays a key role in maintaining blood glucose level.</u> （由于己糖激酶Ⅳ的低葡萄糖亲和力，liver有特殊的生理意义）

![image-20200218210140102](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210140102.png)

### 2. Reaction 2: Isomerization of Glucose-6-phosphate.

The next reaction, catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate <u>isomerase</u> (also called phosphoglucoisomerase), is the readily reversible isomerization of the <u>aldose</u>, **glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)**, to the corresponding <u>ketose</u>, **fructose-6-phosphate (F6P).**

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210225669.png" alt="image-20200218210225669" style="zoom:80%;" />

This isomerization reaction proceeds via an <u>enediolate</u> intermediate.

B: and B-H represent active-site amino acid residues acting as bases and acids, respectively.

![image-20200218210241880](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210241880.png)

### 3. Reaction 3: The Second Investment of ATP

**Phosphofructokinase (PFK，磷酸果糖激酶)** catalyzes a <u>second ATP-dependent phosphorylation</u>, to give a hexose derivative, **fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP)**, phosphorylated at both carbons 1 and 6.

Transferring the carbonyl oxygen from carbon 1 to carbon 2 has two important effects: 

The hydroxyl group generated at carbon 1 can be readily phosphorylated in the reaction 3. 

It also sets up the sugar for a symmetric aldol cleavage in reaction 4. 

The <u>phosphofructokinase reaction</u> is the primary step at which glycolysis is regulated. 重要的反应，与调节密切相关

![image-20200218210308344](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210308344.png)

### 4. Reaction 4: Cleavage to Two Triose Phosphates

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate **aldolase（醛缩酶）**, catalyzes the “<u>splitting of sugar</u>” that is connoted by the term glycolysis.

The six-carbon sugar fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved to give 2 three-carbon intermediates, **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP，3-磷酸甘油醛)** and **dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP，磷酸二羟基丙酮)**.

Aldolase cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate under <u>intracellular conditions</u>, even though the equilibrium lies far toward fructose-1,6-bisphosphate under standard conditions. 

↑ 细胞外的反应条件与机体内不同，因此反应也可能有所影响

![image-20200218210342452](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210342452.png)

**Reaction mechanism for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase: **

A protonated <u>Schiff base intermediate (iminium ion)</u> occurs between the substrate and an active site lysine residue. 

An aspartate residue facilitates the reaction via general acid–base catalysis.

### 5. Reaction 5: Isomerization of Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate

The function of reaction 5, catalyzed by  triose phosphate **isomerase**, is conversion of one of the products from reaction 4, **dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)**, to the other, **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP)**.

![image-20200218210524544](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210524544.png)

### 1. Reaction 6: Generation of the First Energy-Rich Compound

This reaction, catalyzed by **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP)** <u>dehydrogenase</u>, is among the <u>most important</u> in glycolysis, partly because it generates the first intermediate with <u>high phosphate transfer potential</u> and partly because it generates a <u>pair of reducing equivalents.</u> 

![image-20200218210711871](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210711871.png)

<u>**The only Redox reaction in glycolysis.**</u>

This mechanism conserves the energy of oxidation by coupling an <u>exergonic</u> reaction to an <u>endergonic</u> reaction:

### 2. Reaction 7: The First Substrate-Level Phosphorylation


Because of its high phosphate transfer potential, **1,3-bisphosphoglycerate** has a strong tendency to transfer its acyl-phosphate group to ADP, with resultant formation of ATP. 

This substrate-level phosphorylation reaction is catalyzed by **phosphoglycerate kinase**.

![image-20200218210840958](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210840958.png)

Phosphoglycerate kinase catalyzes the first glycolytic reaction that forms ATP. （ADP作为底物接受高能磷酸基）

The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase are thermodynamically coupled:

![image-20200218210855815](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210855815.png)

### 3. Reaction 8: Preparing for Synthesis of the Next High-Energy Compound


Activation of 3-phosphoglycerate begins with an isomerization catalyzed by phosphoglycerate **mutase（变位酶）**. 

The enzyme transfers phosphate from position 3 to position 2 of the substrate to yield 2-phosphoglycerate. 

![image-20200218210933616](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210933616.png)

![image-20200218210947002](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210947002.png)

Reaction 8 is slightly endergonic under standard conditions. 

However, the intracellular level of 3-phosphoglycerate is high relative to that of 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), so that in vivo the reaction proceeds to the right without difficulty.

The enzyme contains a phosphohistidine residue in the active site. 

In the first step of the reaction, the phosphate is transferred from the enzyme to the substrate to give an intermediate, 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate. 

Transfer of the phosphate from C-3 to the active site of the enzyme regenerates the phosphorylated enzyme and forms the product, which is released.

![image-20200218210951345](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218210951345.png)

### 4. Reaction 9: Synthesis of the Second High-Energy Compound


Reaction 9, catalyzed by **enolase**, generates **phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)**, another compound <u>with very high phosphate transfer potential.</u> 

PEP participates in the <u>second substrate-level phosphorylation of glycolysis.</u>

![image-20200218211013700](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211013700.png)

### 5. Reaction 10: The Second Substrate-Level Phosphorylation


In the last reaction, catalyzed by **pyruvate kinase (PK，丙酮酸激酶)**, phosphoenolpyruvate transfers its phosphoryl group to ADP in another substrate-level phosphorylation.

Note that the enzyme is named as if it were acting leftward in the reaction shown below, even though it is <u>strongly exergonic</u> in the rightward direction. 

Many enzymes were named before the function or direction of intracellular catalysis had been identified.

![image-20200226102531671](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200226102531671.png)

# 三、Metabolic Fates of Pyruvate

**The reaction mechanism of pyruvate kinase:**

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211038070.png" alt="image-20200218211038070" style="zoom: 80%;" />

**Pyruvate kinase (PK)** is another site for metabolic <u>regulation</u>. 

PK, like many enzymes, exists in animal tissues as multiple isozymes. 

Mammals carry two paralogous（串列的） pyruvate kinase genes, which, through alternative splicing, produce <u>four different PK isozymes.</u>

All four PK isozymes are homotetramers of 60 kDa subunits, and except for the <u>M1 isozyme</u>, require <u>allosteric activation</u> by f<u>ructose-1,6-bisphosphate</u> for full activity. 

The <u>L</u> and <u>R</u> isozymes are <u>allosterically inhibited at high ATP concentrations.</u> 

The <u>M1</u> isozyme, on the other hand, is <u>constitutively active</u>.

<u>Dietary carbohydrate induces the biosynthesis of pyruvate kinase</u> and increases the ability of the body to obtain energy from glycolysis.

![image-20200218211222410](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211222410.png)

在细胞内部反应 (-102.9)相比于标准条件下 (-83.1)更容易进行（对比$\Delta G^{\circ \prime},\Delta G$）

Pyruvate represents a <u>central metabolic branch point</u>. 

Its fate depends crucially on the <u>oxidation state</u> of the cell, which is related to the reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (**GAP**) dehydrogenase (reaction 6). 

Recall that this reaction converts 1 mole of **NAD+** per mole of triose phosphate to **NADH**. 

The cytoplasm has a <u>finite supply of NAD+</u> so <u>this NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for glycolysis to continue.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211416798.png" alt="image-20200218211416798" style="zoom: 80%;" />

Pyruvate must be reduced to <u>lactate</u> when tissues are <u>insufficiently aerobic</u> to <u>oxidize</u> all of the **NADH** formed in glycolysis.

<u>Microorganisms</u> can <u>oxidize NADH</u> via fermentations producing <u>lactate or ethanol</u>.

### 1. Animal cells

<u>Aerobic glycolysis:</u> 
1)pyruvate →acetyl-CoA →citric acid  cycle → 15 ATP; 
2) cytoplasic NADH →mitochondrial electron transport chain → O2 → 2.5 or 1.5 ATP;

**Anaerobic glycolysis :**
**RBC (Red Blood Cell)**: derive most of their energy from anaerobic glycolysis;
**Skeletal muscle:** during exertion, pyruvate →lactate (NADH → NAD+); Lactate is an intermediate rather than “dead end” (too much lactate reduces blood pH)
2) Lactate (muscle)→blood → liver → glucose →muscle (**Cori cycle**)
3) Lactate (muscle) →heart →pyruvate (**LDH**)→acetyl-CoA →citric acid  cycle → ATP for heart

### 2. Yeast converts pyruvate to ethanol in a two-step pathway

This alcoholic fermentation starts with the <u>nonoxidative decarboxylation</u> of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, catalyzed by **pyruvate decarboxylase**. 

<u>NAD+ is regenerated</u> in the next reaction, the NADH-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol, catalyzed by **alcohol dehydrogenase**.

![image-20200218211503527](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211503527.png)

#### Ethanol intoxication 

1. deplete NAD+, reduces flux from GAP dehydrogenase reaction and glycolysis; 
2. Acetaldehyde is quite toxic.

乙醇脱氢酶把乙醇氧化成乙醛（这个过程消耗NAD+，即生成乙醇的逆反应）；乙醛脱氢酶把乙醛变成乙酸

如果乙醛脱氢酶无法及时将乙醛转化，乙醛的毒性就会对身体造成影响，可能致癌

---

The first reaction requires **thiamine（硫铵素） pyrophosphate (TPP)** as a coenzyme. 

The vitamin is structurally complex, but its conversion to the coenzyme form, thiamine pyrophosphate, or **TPP,** involves simply an ATP-dependent pyrophosphorylation.

**Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)** is the <u>coenzyme for all decarboxylations of α-keto acid</u>s. 

Unlike β-keto acids, α-keto acids cannot stabilize the carbanion transition state that develops during decarboxylation, and they thus require the aid of a cofactor (TPP).

The **thiazole ring** of TPP is the functional part of the coenzyme, allowing it to bind and transfer activated aldehydes.

![image-20200218211545694](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211545694.png)

Because the thiazole ring is weakly acidic (pKa ~ 18 for the ring hydrogen), a general base is required in its ionization. 

As shown in the following diagram, a glutamate carboxyl group in the enzyme deprotonates N-1 of the pyrimidine, which in turn increases the basicity of the amino group, facilitating the deprotonation of C-2 of the thiazole ring to give a dipolar thiazolium carbanion (or ylid).

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211555009.png" alt="image-20200218211555009" style="zoom: 67%;" />

**Thiamine pyrophosphate in the pyruvate decarboxylase reaction:** 

The key reaction (step 2) is attack by the carbanion of TPP on the carbonyl carbon of pyruvate and is followed by nonoxidative decarboxylation of the coenzyme-bound pyruvate to give another carbanion (step 3), which is resonance-stabilized.

# 四、Energy and Electron Balance Sheets

Glycolysis, which yields 2 ATP per glucose, is <u>fast</u> but releases only a <u>small fraction</u> of the energy available from glucose.（<u>100 times faster than aerobic oxidation phosphorylation</u>）

Glycosis的优势和重要性在于速度快

In <u>alcoholic fermentation</u> as in lactate fermentation, an exergonic process <u>coupled</u> to an endergonic process. （Muscle cells, cancer cell）

只有27%的能量转变为ATP，剩余的能量转变为热能释放。

**Industrial production of ethanol; replacement of non-renewable petroleum:**

Bioengineering bacterial strains: cellulose (<u>waste wood</u>)→ hexose sugar → ethanol

Concern: technical hurdles, water demand; green emission

## Energy profile of anaerobic glycolysis


Most of the reactions function at or near equilibrium and are freely reversible in vivo. 

The <u>three enzymes</u> that catalyze reactions so <u>highly exergonic</u> as to be virtually <u>irreversible (arrows)</u> are subject to allosteric control.

# 五、Gluconeogenesis

### 1. Synthesis and use of glucose in the human body

<u>Liver and kidney cortex</u> are the primary gluconeogenic tissues. （糖异生的主要器官在肝脏）

<u>Brain, skeletal muscle, kidney medulla, erythrocytes, and testes</u> use glucose as their sole or primary energy source, but they lack the enzymatic machinery to synthesize it.

Synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors is essential for <u>maintenance of blood glucose</u> levels within acceptable limits.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218211848682.png" alt="image-20200218211848682" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Gluconeogenesis uses specific enzymes to <u>bypass three irreversible reactions of glycolysis.</u>

## Reactions of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis


Irreversible reactions of glycolysis are shown in <u>dark purple</u>. 

The opposed reactions in gluconeogenesis, which bypass these steps, are shown in <u>dark blue</u>. 

<u>Pale arrows</u> identify reversible reactions used in both pathways.

### 1. Bypass 1: Conversion of Pyruvate to Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)

The bypass of pyruvate kinase begins in the <u>mitochondrion</u> and involves two reactions.

**Pyruvate carboxylase (PC，丙酮酸羧化酶)** catalyzes the <u>ATP</u>- and <u>biotin</u>-dependent conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. 

The enzyme requires <u>acetyl-CoA as an allosteric activator</u>:

![image-20200218212011221](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212011221.png)

To be used for gluconeogenesis, **oxaloacetate（草酰乙酸）** <u>must move out of the mitochondrion to the cytosol, where the remainder of the pathway occurs.</u>

However, the mitochondrial membrane does not have an effective transporter for oxaloacetate. 

Therefore, oxaloacetate is reduced by <u>mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase to</u> **malate（苹果酸）**, which is transported into the <u>cytosol</u> by exchange for orthophosphate and then reoxidized by **cytosolic malate dehydrogenase（苹果酸脱氢酶）**.

Once in the cytosol, oxaloacetate is acted on by **phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  (PEPCK)** to give phosphoenolpyruvate:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212037014.png" alt="image-20200218212037014" style="zoom:150%;" />

### 2. Bypass 2: Conversion of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to Fructose-6-phosphate


The **PFK** reaction of glycolysis is essentially irreversible, but only because it is driven by phosphate transfer from ATP. 

A bypass reaction in gluconeogenesis involves a simple <u>hydrolytic reaction,</u> catalyzed by **fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase (FBPase)**.


### 3. Bypass 3: Conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to Glucose


Glucose-6-phosphate cannot be converted to glucose by reverse action of <u>hexokinase or glucokinase</u> because of the high positive $\Delta G ^{\circ}$ of that reaction; phosphate transfer from ATP makes that reaction virtually irreversible. 

Another enzyme specific to gluconeogenesis, **glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)**, also involves a simple <u>hydrolysis</u>.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212145282.png" alt="image-20200218212145282" style="zoom: 33%;" />

PEPCK isozymes provide alternative routes to PEP and cytoplasmic reducing equivalents:

Six high-energy phosphate group (4ATP+2GTP)

2NADH→ electron transport chain→ 5 ATP

So, it is very energetically expensive process!

Outline of pathways for glucose synthesis from the major **gluconeogenic precursors**:

Note that both glucose and lactate are carried in the <u>blood</u>.

The equivalent of <u>11 high-energy phosphates</u>（4+2+2*2.5） are consumed per mole of glucose synthesized by gluconeogenesis.

The most important gluconeogenic precursors are **lactate**, **alanine（丙氨酸（蛋白代谢））**, **glycerol（甘油（脂肪代谢））**, and **propionate（丙酸（脂肪代谢））**.

<u>Animals cannot undergo net conversion of fat to carbohydrate.</u>

+ However, 脂肪里面的甘油部分可以变成糖

#### The Cori cycle

Lactate produced in glycolysis during muscle exertion is transported to the liver, for resynthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. 

Transport of glucose back to muscle for synthesis of glycogen, and its reutilization in glycolysis, completes the cycle.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212323046.png" alt="image-20200218212323046" style="zoom: 67%;" />

In all organisms a three-carbon acyl-CoA, **propionyl-CoA**, is generated either from the breakdown of <u>some amino acids</u> or from the oxidation of fatty acids <u>with odd numbers of carbon atoms</u>. 

+ 机体内的大多数脂肪酸都是双数碳（Even Number），原因是合成的时候使用了乙酰辅酶A
+ 偶数碳的脂肪酸无法变成糖，但是少数的奇数碳的脂肪酸经过一系列反应可以变成糖

**Propionyl-CoA** enters gluconeogenesis via its conversion to **succinyl-CoA** and then to oxaloacetate. 

The process involves a coenzyme derived from **vitamin B~12~**.

# 六、Coordinated Regulation of Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis

<u>Louis Pasteur</u> observed that when <u>anaerobic yeast</u> cultures metabolizing glucose were exposed to <u>air</u>, t<u>he rate of glucose utilization decreased dramatically</u>. 

It became clear that this phenomenon, known as the ***Pasteur effect***, <u>involves the inhibition of glycolysis by oxygen.</u> 

This effect makes biological sense because <u>far more energy</u> is derived from complete oxidation of glucose than from glycolysis alone.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212359597.png" alt="image-20200218212359597" style="zoom:67%;" />

```
“Warburg effect” (1925): cancer cells metabolize glucose by glycolysis, producing lactate, even though oxygen is abundant.

## Periodic oscillations of the levels of glycolytic intermediates in yeast cells undergoing glycolysis 

The culture was shifted from <u>aerobic to anaerobic</u> conditions at the point labeled “<u>Air off</u>.” 

The upper tracing depicts continuous monitoring of fluorescence of the cell suspension, which is related to the intracellular concentration of **NADH**. 

The nucleotide levels were determined in a parallel experiment in which samples of culture were removed at various times, extracted, and assayed for their contents of ATP, ADP, and AMP

## Comparative substrate cycles in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis

![image-20200218212531884](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212531884.png)

## Major control mechanisms affecting glycolysis and gluconeogenesis 

Note the strongly exergonic reactions of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and the major activators and inhibitors of these reactions.

Low energy charge→activates rate-limiting steps in glycolysis (HK, PFK and PK);
High energy charge→inhibits rate-limiting steps in glycolysis (HK, PFK and PK) ;

**Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP，果糖2,6 双磷酸)** is the most important regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

It is synthesized and degraded by different forms of the same enzyme.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212636363.png" alt="image-20200218212636363" style="zoom: 150%;" />

同时具有PFK，FBPase的活性

#### Regulation of the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in liver

The <u>bifunctional PFK-2/FBPase-2</u> is controlled by <u>reversible phosphorylation</u> of a specific <u>serine residue</u> near the N-terminus of each subunit of the homodimeric protein. 

In the <u>unphosphorylated</u> form, the 6-phosphofructo-2-<u>kinase</u> domain (K) is active, and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate <u>(F2,6BP) is synthesized.</u> 

In the <u>phosphorylated</u> form, the fructose-2,6-<u>bisphosphatase</u> domain (B) is active, and <u>F2,6BP is degraded.</u> 

**Glucagon（胰高血糖素）** stimulates phosphorylation by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 

<u>**Insulin** and **glucose** (via **xyulose-5-phosphate**)</u> stimulate dephosphorylation by activating a protein phosphatase. （使得Kinase活性激活，对glucose的利用加快，从而使得血糖浓度下降）

Glucagon→ receptor (GPCR)→cAMP → PKA →PFK-2/FBPase-2 phosphorylation →FBPase-2 activity↑→ [F2,6BP]↓ → PFK-1↓  →glycolysis ↓ →blood glucose level ↑ 

Insulin →PFK-2/FBPase-2 dephosphorylation →PFK-2 kinase activity ↑ → [F2,6BP] ↑ → PFK-1 ↑  →glycolysis ↑ →blood glucose level ↓

### 3. Regulation of <u>liver hexokinase</u> by protein–protein interactions

<u>Activity of the liver hexokinase **isozyme IV (HKIV)**</u> is regulated <u>by</u> alternative protein–protein interactions with the **glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP)** <u>in the nucleus and dephosphorylated PFK- 2/FBPase-2 in the cytoplasm.</u> 

**Insulin** binding to its plasma membrane receptor stimulates <u>dephosphorylation of PFK-2/FBPase-2.</u>

# 八、Entry of Other Sugars into the Glycolytic Pathway

## Routes for utilizing substrates other than glucose in glycolysis

In animals, most of the carbohydrate other than glucose and glycogen comes from the diet, and most of the glycerol is derived from lipid catabolism.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218212958149.png" alt="image-20200218212958149"  />

## Leloir pathway for utilizing galactose by converting it to glucose-6-phosphate

The galactose and glucose rings are colored blue and orange, respectively, to emphasize that reaction 3 is a <u>group transfer</u>, not an **epimerization（差向异构）**. 

Recall that glucose and galactose are epimers at C-4.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213120170.png" alt="image-20200218213120170" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Maltose, lactose, Surcose and Fat

The three disaccharides most abundant in foods are maltose, lactose, and sucrose

**Maltose** is available primarily as an artificial sweetener, derived from starch, while <u>lactose and sucrose</u> are abundant natural products. 

In animal metabolism they are hydrolyzed in cells lining the small intestine, to give the constituent hexose sugars:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213134618.png" alt="image-20200218213134618" style="zoom: 80%;" />

**Asian lactose intolerance**: lactase in their intestines

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213153673.png" alt="image-20200218213153673" style="zoom: 80%;" />

The digestion of neutral **fat (triacylglycerols)** and most **phospholipids** generates **glycerol** as one product. 

In animals, glycerol first enters the glycolytic pathway by the action in <u>liver of glycerol kinase</u>.

The product is then oxidized by **glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase**  to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is catabolized by glycolysis.

合成脂肪的时候，需要DHAP去合成glycerol-3-phosphate，因此脂肪的合成代谢也需要糖

# 九、Polysaccharide Metabolism

In animal metabolism, <u>two primary sources of glucose</u> are derived from polysaccharides:


1. Digestion of dietary polysaccharides, chiefly **starch** from plant foodstuffs and **glycogen** from meat.
2. Mobilization of the animal’s own **glycogen** reserves.

## Cleavage of a glycosidic bond by hydrolysis or Phosphorolysis

This formal diagram shows how the elements of water or phosphoric acid, respectively, are added across a glycosidic bond.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213343836.png" alt="image-20200218213343836" style="zoom:23%;" />

<u>Dietary polysaccharides</u> are metabolized by <u>hydrolysis</u> to monosaccharides. 

<u>Intracellular carbohydrate stores</u>, as **glycogen**, are mobilized as phosphorylated monosaccharides by <u>phosphorolysis</u>.

$\alpha $**-Amylase in saliva** cleaves bonds a(1$\rarr$4) between the maltose units of amylopectin（支链淀粉） (or glycogen).

However, it cannot cleave $\alpha $(1$\rarr$6) glycosidic bonds in the branched polymer, and a limit **dextrin（糊精）** accumulates unless $\alpha  $(1$\rarr $6)-glucosidase (debranching enzyme) is present. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213408179.png" alt="image-20200218213408179" style="zoom:25%;" />

# 十、Glycogen Metabolism in Muscle and Liver

The principal **glycogen** stores in <u>vertebrates</u> are in <u>skeletal muscle and liver</u>.

Breakdown of these stores into usable energy, or <u>mobilization of glycogen</u>, involves sequential phosphorolytic cleavages of bonds, catalyzed by <u>glycogen phosphorylase</u>. 

In <u>plants</u>, starch is similarly mobilized by the action of <u>starch phosphorylase</u> . 

Both reactions release **glucose-1-phosphate** from <u>nonreducing ends</u> of the glucose polymer:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213321747.png" alt="image-20200218213321747" style="zoom: 80%;" />

The <u>debranching</u> process in glycogen catabolism:


1. A glycogen chain following activity by **phosphorylase (磷酸化酶)**, which cleaves off glucose residues to within f<u>our residues</u> of the branch point. 

2. The glycogen chain following <u>transferase activity</u> by the <u>debranching enzyme</u>. The <u>three</u> remaining glucose residues with linkage have been <u>transferred to a nearby nonreducing end</u>.

3. The glycogen chain following <u>α(1$\rarr$6)-glucosidase activity</u> by the <u>debranching enzyme</u>, which has removed the last remaining glucose residue of the branch. 

   + Phosphorylase will cleave off all but four glucose units of the newly elongated branch, beginning the debranching process again. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213443875.png" alt="image-20200218213443875" style="zoom:25%;" />

**UDP-glucose** is the metabolically activated form of glucose for glycogen synthesis.

所有的葡萄糖，只有变成UDP-Glc，才能用于合成糖原。这个转变的过程消耗能量，参与的分子是UDP。

Glycogen biosynthesis requires <u>glycogen synthase</u> for polymerization and a **transglycosylase（转糖苷酶）** to create branches.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213519490.png" alt="image-20200218213519490" style="zoom: 50%;" />

**The glycogen synthase reaction:**

# 十一、Coordinated Regulation of Glycogen Metabolism

The <u>branching</u> process in glycogen synthesis.

Branching is brought about by the action of **amylo-(1,4$\rarr$1,6)-transglycosylase**.

由α1,4转变为α1,6，因此形成了分叉

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213615811.png" alt="image-20200218213615811" style="zoom: 50%;" />

Glycogen mobilization is controlled hormonally by a metabolic cascade that is activated by cAMP formation and involves successive phosphorylations of enzyme proteins.

The rapid mobilization of muscle glycogen triggered by epinephrine is one of several components of the “fight or flight” response.

## The regulatory cascade controlling glycogen breakdown

Epinephrine（肾上腺素）, glucagon（胰高血糖素）：

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213729203.png" alt="image-20200218213729203" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Control of glycogen phosphorylase activity

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218213925449.png" alt="image-20200218213925449" style="zoom: 50%;" />

激酶使得T state磷酸化，从而激活活性

<u>Conditions that activate glycogen breakdown inhibit glycogen synthesis, and vice versa.</u>

<u>Glycogen synthase</u> activity is controlled by phosphorylation, through mechanisms comparable to those controlling glycogen breakdown by phosphorylase but having reciprocal effects on enzyme activity.

G6P <u>favors T state</u> of glycogen phosphorylase a, which is dephosphorylated by PP1c → glycogen phosphorylase a → glycogen breakdown ↓ glycogen synthesis ↑

# 十二、A Biosynthetic Pathway That Oxidizes Glucose: The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP)

The **pentose phosphate pathway（戊糖磷酸途径）** <u>converts glucose to various other sugars</u>, which can be used for <u>energy</u>. 

Its most important products, however, are **NADPH** and **ribose-5-phosphate (R5P，5-磷酸核酮糖)**. R5P是合成DNA，RNA的部件分子。

In stage 1, the <u>oxidative phase</u>, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to <u>ribulose-5-phosphate</u> and CO2, with production of NADPH. 

The remaining stages constitute the <u>nonoxidative phase</u> of the pathway.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218214153449.png" alt="image-20200218214153449" style="zoom:33%;" />

## Oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway

The three reactions of the oxidative phase include <u>two oxidations</u>（脱氢）, which <u>produce NADPH</u>.

The pentose phosphate pathway primarily generates <u>NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis.</u>

In the **nonoxidative phase**, some of the ribulose-5-phosphate produced in the oxidative phase is converted to ribose-5 phosphate by phosphopentose isomerase.

The reaction sequence of the nonoxidative branch converts **3 five-carbon sugar phosphates** to **2 six-carbon sugar phosphates** and **1 three-carbon sugar phosphate**. 

The **hexose phosphates（己糖磷酸）** formed can be catabolized either by recycling through the pentose phosphate pathway or by glycolysis. 

The **triose phosphate（丙糖磷酸）** is **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate**, a glycolytic intermediate. 

Three enzymes involved are: 

+ phosphopentose epimerase 磷酸戊糖差向异构酶

+ transketolase 转酮醇酶
+ transaldolase 转醛缩酶

The nonoxidative branch begins with both <u>ribulose-5-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate</u>.

Transketolase catalyzes a transfer of a two-carbon fragment from xylulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate to give a triose phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and a seven-carbon sugar, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate.

In the final reaction of pentose phosphate catabolism, transketolase acts on another molecule of xylulose-5-phosphate, transferring a glycolaldehyde fragment to **erythrose-4-phosphate** and generating a three-carbon product and a six-carbon product—glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, respectively.

Transketolase requires a TPP cofactor to transfer its 2-carbon unit as an activated aldehyde.

The pentose phosphate pathway has <u>different modes of operation</u> to meet varying metabolic needs. 


1. When the primary need is for <u>nucleotide biosynthesis</u>, the primary product is ribose-5-phosphate. Reducing equivalents from NADPH are used to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotide. 
2. When the primary need is for <u>reducing power (NADPH)</u>, fructose phosphates are reconverted to glucose-6-phosphate for reoxidation in the oxidative phase.
3. When only moderate quantities of pentose phosphates and NADPH are needed, the pathway can also be used to <u>supply energy</u>, with the reaction products being oxidized through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
