###### Cell Wall Biosynthesis

![image-20210530160019286](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530160019286.png)

Firstly, N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) is linked to three amino acids (^L^Ala-^D^Glu-^L^Lys)

The tripeptide is then linked to ^D^Ala-^D^Ala

The resulting pentapeptide glycopeptide is attached to a C55 carrier lipid by a translocase enzyme, and carried to the outer surface of the cell membrane

In the following step N-acteylglucosamine (NAG) is added

Afterwards a pentaglycine chain is linked to the peptide part 

A transglycosylase enzyme catalyses the attachment of the disaccharide building block to the growing cell wall, and releases the lipid carrier

###### Chain elongation

###### Penecillin

Discovery of Penicillin

+ Alexander Flemming discovers in 1928 that a fungus grew on a bacterial plate containing staphylococci. Close to the fungus all bacteria were killed. 
+ Biotechnological production of penicillins was established during the second world war and helped saving the life of many soldiers. •
+ Fleming, Chain und Florey received the Nobel price 1945

**Antibacterials that inhibit the cell wall synthesis**

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530161204403.png" alt="image-20210530161204403" style="zoom:67%;" />

+ Antibacterial agents which inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis 
+ Discovered by Fleming from a fungal colony (1928) 
+ Shown to be non toxic and antibacterial 
+ Isolated and purified by Florey and Chain (1938) 
+ First successful clinical trial (1941) 
+ Produced by large scale fermentation (1944) 
+ Structure established by X-Ray crystallography (1945) 
+ Full synthesis developed by Sheehan (1957) 
+ Isolation of 6-APA by Beechams (1958-60) development of semi-synthetic penicillins 
+ Discovery of clavulanic acid and β-lactamase inhibitors

**Mechanism of action bacterial cell wall synthesis**

+ Penicillin inhibits final crosslinking stage of cell wall synthesis 
+ It reacts with the transpeptidase enzyme to form an irreversible covalent bond 
+ Inhibition of transpeptidase leads to a weakened cell wall 
+ Cells swell due to water entering the cell, then burst (lysis) 
+ Penicillin possibly acts as an analogue of the L-Ala-γ-D-Ala portion of the pentapeptide chain. However, the carboxylate group that is essential to penicillin activity is not present in this portion

![image-20210530161721488](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530161721488.png)

**Conclusions**

+ Amide and carboxylic acid are involved in binding 
+ Carboxylic acid binds as the carboxylate ion 
+ Mechanism of action involves the β-lactam ring 
+ Activity related to β-lactam ring strain (subject to stability factors) 
+ Bicyclic system increases β-lactam ring strain 
+ Not much variation in structure is possible 
+ Variations are limited to the side chain (R)

###### Resistance to Penicillins

Gram negative bacteria have a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane preventing access to the cell wall 

+ Penicillins can only cross via porins in the outer membrane 
+ Porins only allow small hydrophilic molecules that can exist as zwitterions to cross 

High levels of transpeptidase enzyme may be present 

The transpeptidase enzyme may have a low affinity for penicillins (e.g. PBP 2a for S. aureus) 

Presence of β-lactamases 

Concentration of β-lactamases in periplasmic space 

Mutations 

Transfer of β-lactamases between strains 

Efflux mechanisms pumping penicillin out of periplasmic space

###### Problems with Penicillin G

It is sensitive to stomach acids 

It is sensitive to β-lactamases enzymes which hydrolyse the β-lactam ring 

It has a limited range of activity

![image-20210530162230081](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530162230081.png)

###### Sensitivity to β-Lactamases

Enzymes that inactivate penicillins by opening β-lactam rings 

Allow bacteria to be resistant to penicillin 

Transferable between bacterial strains (i.e. bacteria can acquire resistance) 

Important w.r.t. Staphylococcus aureus infections in hospitals 

+ 80% Staph. infections in hospitals were resistant to penicillin and other antibacterial agents by 1960 

Mechanism of action for lactamases is identical to the mechanism of inhibition for the target enzyme 

+ But product is removed efficiently from the lactamase active site

![image-20210530162435477](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530162435477.png)

Block access of penicillin to active site of enzyme by introducing bulky groups to the side chain to act as steric shields 

Size of shield is crucial to inhibit reaction of penicillins with βlactamases but not with the target enzyme (transpeptidase)

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530162453181.png" alt="image-20210530162453181" style="zoom: 43%;" />

**Advantages**

+ Non toxic 
+ Lower risk of allergic reactions compared to penicillins 
+ More stable to acid conditions 
+ More stable to β-lactamases 
+ Ratio of activity vs Gram -ve and Gram +ve bacteria is better

**SAR**

+ The β-lactam ring is crucial to the mechanism 
+ The carboxylic acid at position 4 is important to binding 
+ The bicyclic system is important in increasing ring strain 
+ Stereochemistry is important 
+ The acetoxy substituent is important to the mechanism 
+ Possible modifications 
+ 7-Acylamino side chain 
+ 3-Acetoxymethyl side chain 
+ Substitution at C-7

+ Potent and wide range of activity vs Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacteria 
+ Active vs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
+ Low toxicity 
+ High resistance to β-lactamases 
+ Poor stability in solution (ten times less stable than Pen G)

##### (6) β-Lactamase Inhibitors

**Clavulanic acid** (Beechams 1976)(from Streptomyces clavuligerus)

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530163918785.png" alt="image-20210530163918785" style="zoom: 50%;" />

+ Weak, unimportant antibacterial activity 
+ Powerful irreversible inhibitor of β-lactamases suicide substrate 
+ Used as a sentry drug for ampicillin 
+ Augmentin = ampicillin + clavulanic acid 
+ Allows less ampicillin per dose and an increased activity spectrum 
+ Timentin = ticarcillin + clavulanic acid

##### (7) Glycopeptide antibiotics: Vancomycin

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530164116570.png" alt="image-20210530164116570" style="zoom: 25%;" />

+ Vancomycin forms tight hydrogen bonds with the DAla-DAla terminal unit of the pentapeptide, thereby capping the pentapeptides 
+ Vancomycin can form rather stable head-to-tail dimers 
+ Due to the large size of Vancomycin it acts as a steric block preventing access from the transglycosylase and transpeptidase enzymes

**Structure of the complex between Vacomycin and a tripeptide**

### 4. The ribosomes: Drugs that interfere protein synthesis

ribosomes are the location of protein biosynthesis 

ribosomes consist of both proteins and RNA 

the active site for peptide bond formation consists solely of rRNA 

it consists of a large (50S) and a small (30S) subunit

![image-20210530164901970](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530164901970.png)

#### Ribosomes are made of RNA and proteins

![image-20210530164911754](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530164911754.png)

+ Left: Structure of the 30S subunit from T. thermophilus
+ Right: Structure of the 50S subunit from D. radiodurans

#### Interference with protein synthesis by blocking protein translation

![image-20210530165008929](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530165008929.png)

![image-20210530165027789](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530165027789.png)

+ the ribosome employs entropic catalysis by positioning substrates, re-organizing water and providing an electrostatic network to stabilize reaction intermediates

mRNA passes through two narrow channels on the 30S subunit to be displayed at the interface decoding site where it interacts with the tRNA anticodon 

Initially the start codon is translocated into the P site on the 30S subunit to interact with the initiator tRNA charged with Met 

the second mRNA codon , in the adjacent A site, accepts the next tRNA. Basepair matching is checked by the decoding site 

If it matches, the aminoacyl end of the tRNA is swung to the peptidyl-transferase centre, on the 50S subunit 

The ribosome then moves along the mRNA to bring the next codon into the aminoacyl (A) site. In addition, the tRNA holding the nascent peptide strand is translocated into the peptidyl (P) site 

At the end the full strand is moved into the E (exit) site, from where it is ejected

#### Binding sites for antibiotics

![image-20210530165658293](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530165658293.png)

+ the chain of the nascent polypeptide passes through a narrow tunnel on the 50S subunit, which is 100 Å in length, and runs from the peptidyltransferase centre to emerge from the back of the ribosome
+ the macrolides bind in the narrow tunnel blocking exit of the nascent chain

##### (1) Binding site on the 30S subunit

![image-20210530165819818](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530165819818.png)

During protein synthesis nucleotides A1492 and A1493 are flipped out of the 16S rRNA helix to interact with the mRNA codon and its cognate tRNA anticodon at the ribosomal A-site

some aminoglycosides antibiotics bind within the helix and induce a similar but not identical flip-out of A1493 and A1492

as a result basepair matching is NOT required leading to the addition of incorrect amino acids to the nascent chain.

#### Aminoglycosides

# 三、AIDS, HIV

AIDS represents the classic example of immunodeficiency disease caused by extrinsic factors, in this instance the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

## What is HIV?

![image-20210530170617094](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530170617094.png)

HIV = Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Destroys **CD4** cells (T-cells and macrophages)

AIDS = Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus(~10 years after infection)

This virus exhibits a strong tropism for CD4 T helper cells; these become depleted, giving rise to increased frequency of opportunistic infections and malignancies in infected individuals.
