**Anatomy** is the study of the **STRUCTURES** of the body, and the relationship among structures.

+ This is the **WHAT** and **WHERE** of the body.
+ The word itself means “to cut up.”

**Physiology** is the study of how the body **Functions**.

+ The “how” is often on a chemical level

Anatomy and Physiology are closely integrated, both theoretically and practically

+ All specific functions are performed by specific structures.
+ What a structure can do depends on its specific form

# 一、Levels of Structural Organization

**Chemical** – atoms combined to form molecules

**Cellular** – cells are made of molecules

**Tissue** – consists of similar types of cells

**Organ** – made up of different types of tissues

**Organ system** – consists of different organs that work closely together

**Organism** – made up of the organ systems

#### Excretory System

Functions of the Digestive and Excretory System:

+ Digestion
+ Waste Removal (solid)
+ Conversion of food energy to energy usable by the body
+ Absorption of nutrients

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210114175513912.png" alt="image-20210114175513912" style="zoom:100%;" />

**Mouth**: food is chewed and swallowed, Enzymes are added to food in this process.

**Peristasis**: Process where food is moved through the digestive system by waves of rhythmic muscular contractions

The functions of different parts of the digestive system:

| Part                | Substance Absorped                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Small Intestine** | finish breaking down the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats<br />(Most of the absorption of nutrients takes place in the small intestine) |
| **Large intestine** | Vitamins, Minerals, and Water are absorbed                   |
| **Liver**           | Secretes chemicals that help digest fats in the small intestine. Stores glucose |
| **Pancreas**        | Secretes enzymes that break down carbohydrates and proteins in the small intestine |

#### Human Excretory System

Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes from the body, including toxic chemicals, excess water, carbon dioxide and salts

**Maintains**

+ salt content
+ water content
+ blood pressure
+ acid-base balance

**Excretory Organs**

+ Skin: sweat

+ heart
+ blood vessels

##### (1) Blood

The Blood: Blood cells & Plasma

+ Plasma is fluid portion

**Blood cells**

+ Erythrocytes Red Blood Cells
+ Leucocytes

##### (2) Heart

Heart is a four chambered, hollow muscular organ approximately the size of your fist

Location:

+ Superior surface of diaphragm 横膈膜上表面
+ Left of the midline
+ Anterior to the **vertebral column（脊柱）**, posterior to the sternum（胸骨）

Functions of the heart

+ Generating blood pressure
+ Routing blood: Heart separates pulmonary and systemic circulations
+ Ensuring one-way blood flow: Heart valves ensure one-way flow
+ Regulating blood supply: Changes in contraction rate and force match blood delivery to changing metabolic needs

The structure of heart:

Nephrons

+ Blood filtering units in the kidney
+ Each kidney has millions of them
+ They remove salts, water, and cell waste from the blood
+ 99% of the water removed by the nephrons is reclaimed by the capillaries.
+ Liquid waste is called urine

Diseases due to dysfunctional Urinary system

+ Kidney Failure
+ Kidney Stones
+ Hypertension

#### Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that produce hormones

+ Hypothalamus, pituitary（垂体）, pineal（松果体）, thyroid（甲状腺）, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal, pancreas, ovary, testes

Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the blood stream and affect activities throughout the body

+ Steroid hormones
+ Non-steroid hormones

**Pituitary Gland**:

+ **Function**: It secretes nine hormones that directly regulate many body functions and controls functions of other glands.
+ **Disorders**: To much <u>growth hormones (GH)</u> in early childhood can result in a condition called gigantism. To little GH can result in <u>Pituitary Dwarfism（垂体性侏儒症）.</u>

**Thyroid Gland**

+ **Function**: plays a major role in regulation the body’s metabolism
+ **Disorders**: If the Thyroid Gland produces to much **Thyroxin（甲状腺激素）**, it can cause a condition known as <u>Hyperthyroidism（甲状腺功能亢进）</u>. If to little thyroxin produces it is called <u>Hypothyroidism（甲状腺机能减退症）</u>

**Pancreas**

+ **Function**: The Insulin and Glucagon in the Pancreas help to <u>keep the level of glucose in the blood stable</u>
+ **Disorders**: When the Pancreas fails to produce or properly use Insulin, it can cause a condition known as <u>Diabetes Mellitus.</u>

**Adrenal Gland**

+ **Functions**: The adrenal glands release Adrenaline in the body that <u>helps prepare for and deal with stress.</u> 
  + Also regulates kidney function

**Ovaries**

+ **Functions**: 
  + Pair of reproductive organs found in women that produce eggs. 
  + Also secrete estrogen and progesterone, which control ovulation and menstruation.

**Testes**

+ **Functions**: 
  + Pair of reproductive glands that produces sperm. 
  + Also secrete Testosterone to give the body its masculine characteristics.
