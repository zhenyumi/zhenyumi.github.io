+ **Insulin**: the storage and anabolic hormone of the body (glycometabolism)
+ **Amylin**: modulates appetite, gastric emptying, and glucagon and insulin secretion
+ **Glucagon**: the hyperglycemic factor that mobilizes glycogen stores

## Disorders of the Pancreas: Diabetes Mellitus

Caused by:

+ Insufficient secretion of insulin
+ Resistance of body cells to the effects of insulin

+ Increases triglyceride synthesis and very-low-density lipoprotein formation

**Effect on muscle:** 

+ Increased protein synthesis 
+ Increases amino acid transport 
+ Increases ribosomal protein synthesis 
+ Increased glycogen synthesis 
+ Increases glucose transport
+ Induces glycogen synthase and inhibits phosphorylase

**Effect on adipose tissue:**

Most patients are treated only with diet modification and moderate exercise but some take anti-diabetic drugs, including insulin therapy.

### 4. Type Ⅳ Diabetes

Other specific types

Drug-induced diabetes : 

+ 1992, anti-hypertensive vasodilator diazoxide, and corticosteroids in high doses could cause diabetes.
+ 2006, antipsychotic drugs： Olanzapine: induces hyperinsulinemia. dozens of those patients died from diabetes-related complications.

### 5. Type Ⅱ Diabetes

adult onset, usually occurs after age 40

**Etiology**: Insulin resistance; relative deficiency in insulin secretion (late stage).

blood glucose levels rise due to :

+ Lack of insulin production
+ Insufficient insulin action (resistant cells)

### 6. Treatment of TypeⅡ Diabetes

#### Drugs

Oral hypoglycemic agent = OHA

OHA s + Insulin therapy

#### Surgery

Surgery: Type 2 diabetes can be cured gastric bypass surgery in 80-100% of Severely obese patients

+ Regular injections (Subcutaneous)
+ Portable pen injections
+ Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices (CSII, insulin pumps)
+ Inhaled insulin

Portable pen injections

+ It is an insulin injection tool that resembles a pen. 
+ This is great for people who need to give themselves an insulin injection when out in public but do not like it to be noticeable. 
+ The Insulin Pen also contains memory of your last 16 injections

Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion CSII

+ Continuous infusion of a short-acting insulin driven by mechanical force and delivered via a needle or soft cannula under the skin.
+ ![image-20210530180814027](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530180814027.png)

Inhaled insulin

+ Inhaled insulin is a powdered form of insulin absorbed by the lungs through use of a hand-held inhaler. 
+ Inhaled insulin is the first noninjectable option.

#### Complications of Insulin Therapy

Hypoglycemia 

Immunopathology: Insulin allergy; Immune insulin resistance (potential vicious cycle) 

Lipodystrophy (abnormal accumulation of fat tissue) at injection sites

**Treatment of Hypoglycemia**

+ **Glucagon**
  + A hormone produced by the alpha cells in the pancreas. 
  + It raises blood glucose. 
  + An injectable form of glucagon

### 2. Oral hypoglycemic agents

#### Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin Secretagogues: agents which increase the amount of insulin secreted

##### (1) Sulfonylureas (SU)

Sulfonylureas were the first widely used oral hypoglycemic medications

###### Mechanism of Action

trigger insulin release by direct action on the K channel of the pancreatic beta cells.

![image-20210530181121585](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530181121585.png)

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530181130864.png" alt="image-20210530181130864" style="zoom:67%;" />

###### Therapeutic uses

Only useful in Type II diabetes

+ They work best with patients over 40 years old, who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years

Diabetes insipidus (large amount of urine)

+ **Chlorpropamide** has also an antidiuretic effect and may be used to treat diabetes insipidus.

###### Adverse reactions

Serious adverse reaction is **hypoglycemia**

Common adverse effects: gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting

##### (2) Meglitinides

###### Uses

Meglitinides help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called "short-acting secretagogues."

Their mode of action is original, affecting **potassium channels**

By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, hence enhancing insulin secretion.

They are taken with meals to boost the insulin response to each meal.

![image-20210530181548941](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530181548941.png)

**repaglinide** (Prandin) The maximum dosage is 16 mg/day, taken 0 to 30 minutes before meals. If a meal is skipped, the medication is also skipped.

**nateglinide** (Starlix) The maximum dosage is 360 mg/day, usually 120 mg three times a day (TID).

###### Adverse reactions

weight gain

hypoglycemia

#### Insulin Sensitisers

Insulin Sensitisers: agents which increase the sensitivity of target to insulin

##### (1) Biguanides

###### Mechanism of action

+ Direct stimulation of glycolysis in tissues, with <u>increased glucose removal from blood</u>
+ inhibiting gluconeogenesis
+ reducing the absorption of glucose from the intestine (influence on gut microbiota)

![image-20210530182500563](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530182500563.png)

###### Therapeutic uses

Metformin is usually the first-line medication used for treatment of type-2 diabetes.

###### Adverse reactions

+ The main adverse reactions of **Phenformin are lactic acidosis (due to high glycolysis)**
+ The most frequent toxic effects of **Metformin** are gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

##### (2) Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)

###### Drugs

+ Pioglitazone
+ Rosiglitazone 
+ Ciglitazone 
+ Englitazone 
+ Troglitazone

![image-20210530182910480](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530182910480.png)

###### Mechanism of action

Enhance the target tissue's sensitivity to insulin through **PPARγ pathway**

PPAR-γ is a type of nuclear regulatory proteins involved in transcription of genes regulating glucose and fat metabolism. These PPARs act on Peroxysome Proliferator Responsive Elements (PPRE). The PPREs influence insulin sensitive genes, which enhance production of mRNAs of insulin dependent enzymes. The final result is <u>better use of glucose</u> by the cells.

#### α-Glucosidase Inhibitors

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: agents which decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

##### (1) Acarbose

![image-20210530182959370](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530182959370.png)

###### Mechanism of action

**Reduces intestinal absorption** of starch and dextrin by inhibiting the action of **α-glucosidase** in intestinal brush border.

###### Clinical use

The agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of <u>impaired glucose tolerance</u>, but can be helpful in combination with other agents in <u>type 2 diabetes</u>

They do have the potential to cause weight loss by lowering the amount of sugar metabolized

#### Peptide analogs

##### Overview of insulin secretion

![image-20210530183156104](https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210530183156104.png)

**Incretin mimetics**

+ **Incretins like GLP1** are insulin secretagogues
+ The main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for being an incretin are **Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)**
+ GLP-1 is rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).

##### (1) Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) analogs

+ GLP agonists bind to a membrane GLP receptor. 
+ As a consequence of this, insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells is increased.

**Exenatide** (also Exendin-4, marketed as Byetta) is the first GLP agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes

It is an injectable medication. (**liraglutide**)

These agents may also cause a decrease in gastric motility, responsible for the common side effect of nausea, and is probably the mechanism by which weight loss occurs

##### (2) DPP-4 inhibitors

**Sitagliptin**

+ an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the enzyme that degrades incretin and other GLP-l-like molecules.
+ increase blood concentration of the incretin GLP-1 
+ This drug appears likely to be approved for use in type 2 diabetes.

##### (3) Amylin analogues

Amylin agonist analogues **slow gastric emptying** and **suppress glucagon**.

**pramlintide** is a clinically available amylin analogue. 

Like insulin, it is administered by **subcutaneous injection.** 

The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is **nausea**, which occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and gradually reduces.
