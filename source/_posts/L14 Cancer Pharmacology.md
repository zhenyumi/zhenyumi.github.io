# 一、Cancer Biology

## What is Cancer

Cancer or Neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue as a result of abnormal proliferation of cells.

Neo-plasm: novel swelling mass in the body

## What are the difference between a normal and cancer cells

### 1. Cell shape

Normal cells:

+ Committed Cells—divide only <u>a defined number of times</u>, and are <u>limited in capacity for self-renewal</u>
+ Specialized Cells—carry out **organ function** and are incapable of cell division
+ **Restricted** to its functional area

**Normal and Cancer Cell Structure**:

### 2. Pathogenesis of Neoplasia

Cancer development can begin with a brief exposure (hours or days) to a chemical into an activated form and the chemical need not be present ever again

However, DNA is altered via mutagens including chemical carcinogens, viruses, and radiation. This mutations is inherted by at least one cell division (intiation).

This mutation mainly lead to activation of proto-oncogene into oncogenes (leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation) and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (leading to resistance to apoptosis.)

Upon exposure to other epigenetic factors (hormones, cocarcinogens, immunosuppressant…which themselves are non carcinogenic) tumor growth is promoted (promotion)

#### Initiation

Initiation point at which an irreversible alteration, usually genetic, is introduced into a target cell

Initiation:

1. is essentially irreversible
2. caused only by carcinogenic compounds
3. occurs rapidly after carcinogen exposure
4. alone does not result in tumor formation

#### Promotion

Promotion is the process whereby an initiated tissue or organ develop focal proliferations and it requires the presence of continuous stimulation.

Promotion:

1. reversible
2. acts only after exposure to an initiating agent
3. requires repeated administration of a promoter
4. is not carcinogenic in itself

# 二、Principle and strategy for cancer therapy

## Cancer Therapeutic Modalities

| Name | Detail  |
|  ----------------- |  ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Surgery | Isolated **solid** cancers  |
| Chemotherapy | Almost **all cases,** in combined with other treatments. It alone cure 10-15% of all patients. |
| Radiation therapy | Used for **half of all cases** to either cure or improve the symptoms of cancer. |
| Palliative care | Symptom management  |

## The log-kill hypothesis

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210524204127022.png" alt="image-20210524204127022" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Infrequent scheduling of treatment courses with low (1 log kill) dosing and a late start prolongs survival but does not cure the patient (i.e., kill rate < growth rate)
+ More intensive and frequent treatment, with adequate (2 log kill) dosing and an earlier start is successful (i.e., kill rate > growth rate)
+ Early surgical removal of the primary tumour decreases the tumour burden. Chemotherapy will remove persistant secondary tumours, and the total duration of therapy does not have to be as long as when chemotherapy alone is used.

## Treatment strategies

Surgery + Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy

Combined Chemotherapy: various classes of drugs in combination 

+ **MP**: Melphalan, prednisone 
+ **VAD**: Vincristine, Adriamycin, dexamethasone 
+ **CHOP**: Cyclophosphomide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone 

Correct selection of drugs in a regimen can result in decreased development of resistance, synergistic effects and decreased toxic effects.

Drug categories:

**Cell Cycle Specifc (CCS)**

| Category | Drugs  |
|  --------------------- |  ----------------------------------------- |
| Antimetabolites | Capecitabine, Cytarabine, Fludarabine, 5-Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine |
| Antitumor antibiotic | Bleomycin  |
| Epipodophyllotoxins | Etoposide, Teniposide  |
| Taxanes | Docetexel, Paclitaxel  |
| Vinca Alkaloids | Vinblastine, Vincristine  |

**Cell Cycle NonSpecifc (CCNS)**

| Category | Drugs  |
|  --------------------- |  ----------------------------------------- |
| Alkylating agents | Busulfan, Carmustine, Melphalan, Thiotepa |
| Anthracyclines | Daunorubucin, Doxorubicin, Idarubicin |
| Antitumor Antibiotics | Dactinomycin, Mtomycin |
| Camptothecins | Irinotecan |
| Platinum analogs | Cisplatin, Carboplatin |

## Problems associated with chemotherapy

### 1. Resistance to chemotherapy

**Resistance to chemotherapy may develop by several mechanisms:** 

+ Decrease in the amount of drug uptake by cancer cells 
   + E.G. Methotrexate
+ Increase in the amount of drug removed by cancer cells. (Transporters=P-glycoprotein).
   + E.G. Vinblastine ,doxorubicin, bleomycin ,etapsoid….
+ Decrease or alteration in target molecule sensitivity – this is caused by mutation in the molecule targeted by the drug
   + E.G. Methotrexate,Mercaptopurine,doxorubicin
+ Increase in DNA repair ability of the cell via an increased expression of DNA repairing enzymes.
   + E.G. Alkylating agent

#### Resistance Mechanisms

Alterations that affect the **mechanism of action** of the drugs:

1. increased DNA repair: crosslinking agents, bleorsycin
2. formation of trapping agents: crosslinking agents
3. changes in target proteins (esp. enzymes): drugs that prevent DNA synthesis, some natural products, signal transduction inhibitors, antibodies

Alterations that affect drug concentrations **inside the tumour cell**:

1. decreased activation of prodrugs: **5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, trinotecan**
2. increased inactivation: antimetabolites (esp. purine analogues)
3. decreased accumulation:
   1. decreased transport into the cell: folate analogues, **mechlorethamine** platins
   2. increased export from the cell due upregulation of efflux transporters(esp <u>increased P-glycoprotein</u>) natural products(esp. anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins)
      + this is an important cause of **multidrug resistance**

+ Encoded by ABCB1 gene

### 2. Toxicity and side Effects of Antineoplastic Agents

Normal cells in the body that tend to be injured the most due to chemotherapy are those which have a high growth fraction. Those are bone marrow, GI Tract ,hair follicles, reproductive organs .Leading to the followings:

+ Alopecia (脱发) - hair loss
+ Myelosuppression  (骨髓功能抑制) - bone marrow loss
+ Emetic potential (呕吐): disruptive to cells in stomach which causes: Nausea/vomiting
+ Low WBC count (低白细胞数目) - low immunity

### 3. Treatment-induced tumor

Many anticancer drugs are mutagens and can cause the rise of neoplasm ten or more years after the original cancer was cured

# 三、Anti-Cancer drugs and their Pharmacology

## Why term chemtherapy

Like infective disease

+ Some malignant cells can be cultured 
+ Some malignancies can be transmitted by innoculation

Cancer chemotherapy not as successful as antimicrobial chemotherapy

Metabolism in parasite differs qualitatively from host cells, while metabolism in cancer cells differ only quantitatively from normal host cells 

+ Hence target selectivity is more difficult in cancer 
+ cancer there is no substantial immune response 
+ Diagnostic complexity: delay in institution of treatment

Cancer cells differ from normal cells by

+ Uncontrolled proliferation
+ De-differentiation loss of function
+ Invasiveness
+ Metastasis

## Cell Cycle and Cancer

#### Mechanism&Usage

Paclitaxel is one of several cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. 

Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs, such as colchicine, that inhibit microtubule assembly, <u>paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly.</u>

**A broad spectrum** : almost all kinds of cancers from all organs, including Brain cancer, blood cancers, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer cancer, prostate cancer….

Kill cancer cells that <u>rapidly grow,</u> or specific genetic presented cancers

More effective when used in **combination** with other drugs or other methods, such as surgery or radiotherapy.

**No anticancer drugs** are perfect that kill cancer cells only.

Most adverse effects are:

1. Myelosuppression—anemia, hemorrhage, prone to infection
2. Somatitis
3. Alopecia
4. Gastrointestinal effects.

# 五、Tumor-Immuno Therapy

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210525175644835.png" alt="image-20210525175644835" style="zoom:100%;" />
## Immune system and cancer

The immune system serves as one of the primary defenses against cancer. <u>When normal tissue becomes a tumor or cancerous tissue, new antigens develop on their surface</u>. 

These antigens send a signal to immune cells such as the T lymphocytes and macrophages, which in turn <u>directly kill</u> the tumor cells or release substances like **cytokines** that may bring about tumor cell death.

+ 2011: Ipiliumumab shows overall survival benefit in melanoma
+ 2012-2014: PD1 and PD-L1 blockade has benefit in melanoma and lung
+ cancer 2011-2014: CAR-modified T cells show durable remissions in leukemia

## Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies are proteins produced in the laboratory from a single clone of a B−cell, the type of cells of the immune system that make antibodies. When used as a treatment for cancer, there are three general strategies with monoclonal antibodies:

+ One uses the ability of the antibodies to <u>bind to the cancer cells having the tumor antigens on their surface.</u> The immune system will see the cancer cells marked with bound antibodies as foreign and destroy them
+ A second strategy is to use the antibodies to <u>block the binding of cytokines or other proteins that are needed by the cancerous cells to maintain their uncontrolled growth</u>. Monoclonal antibodies designed to work like this bind to the cytokine receptors that are on the tumor cell surface.
+ A <u>final</u> strategy involves <u>special antibodies that are linked (conjugated) to a substance that is deadly to the cancer cells</u>. E.G. radioactive isotopes, have been successfully conjugated to antibodies. The antibodies are then used to specifically destroy he tumor cells with the radioactivity or toxic substance

**Trastuzumab** (曲妥珠单抗)

+ Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology that binds specifically to the <u>human epidermal growth factor receptor</u> 2 protein (also known as HER2) that is found on the cell surface of some cancer tumors, most notably breast cancer(25−30% of breast malignancies) and also targets it for destruction by the natural killer cells of immune system.

## Biological response modifiers

Researchers have been working on <u>stimulating the immune cells</u> during cancer with substances broadly classified as biological response modifiers. **Cytokines** are one such substance. These are proteins that are predominantly released by immune cells upon activation or stimulation.

**Aldesleukin**

+ Aldesleukin is interleukin, that is used to treat metastasis renal cell carcinoma (a form of kidney cancer) and metastasis melanoma. Aldesleukin is also known as interleukin−2, IL−2

**Interferons**

+ small, natural cytokines produced by leucocytes ,T−lymphocytes, and fibroblasts <u>to activate tumor−specific cytotoxic T−lymphocytes</u>. Thus, tumor cells would be destroyed based on immunotherapy
+ used to treat cancers such as hairy cell leukemia, malignant melanoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma (an AIDS−related cancer) as well as many other cancers

## Immune therapy can overcome tolerance

Hallmark of cancer: induction of immune tolerance

Gene transfer technology is used to stably express CARs on T cells, conferring novel antigen specificity

CART19 therapy takes advantage of the cytotoxic potential of T cells thereby killing tumor cells in an antigen-dependent manner

Persistent CART19 cells consist of both effector (cytotoxic) and central memory T cells

T cells are non-cross resistant to chemotherapy

Responses are cytolytic: no swelling!
