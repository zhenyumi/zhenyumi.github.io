# 一、Nucleotide And Polynucleotide Chain Structure

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191110100958998.png" alt="image-20191110100958998" style="zoom:67%;" />

## Nucleoside (核苷) And Nucleotide (核苷酸)

### 1. Nucleoside

Adenine + ribose = Adenosine

Adenine + deoxyribose = Deoxyadenosine

### 2. Nucleotide

Base + sugar + phosphate(s) nucleotide

1. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) = Nucleoside + $P$

2. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) = Nucleoside + $PP_{i}$

3. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)

## DNA Polynucleotide Chain Structure

Nucleotides are covalently linked together by **phosphodiester bonds** (磷酸二脂键)

A phosphate <u>connects the 5' carbon of one nucleotide to the 3’ carbon of another</u>

#### The Direction

The chain has 5’ to 3’ direction because the phosphodiester bonds has its direction

#### Backbone

The phosphates and sugar molecules form the backbone of the nucleic acid strand

The bases <u>project from (从…伸出)</u> the backbone.

### 1. Hydrogen-bonds

### 2. Double Helix

+ Two strands are twisted together around a common axis
+ There are **10 bases** and **3.4 nm** per complete turn of helix
+ The two strands are **antiparallel**
+ The helix is right-handed
+ Hydrogen-bonding between complementary bases

#### Two grooves

There are two asymmetrical grooves on the outside of the helix

Major groove and Minor groove

+ Certain proteins binds to these grooves, thus they interacts with a particular sequence of bases

#### Forms of Double Helix

#### Sugar Pucker

### 3. Chromatin And Chromosome

Human genome (in diploid cells) = 6 x $10^{9}$ bp

6 x $10^{9}$ bp X 0.34 nm/bp = 2.04 x $10^{9}$ nm = **2 m/cell**, but diameter of nucleus = 5-10 μm

**So DNA must be packaged** to protect it, but must still be accessible to allow gene expression and cellular response, the solution is cheomosome

#### Chromosome

Chromosome is the complex of single DNA molecular and associated proteins

+ Evident (明显的) during metaphase of Mitosis and Meiosis

The repeating structural unit within eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome

It is composed of a double-stranded segment of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins

+ A histone octamer is composed of two copies each of four different histone proteins

+ 146 bp of DNA make <u>negative superhelical (左旋)</u> turns around the octamer
+ DNA is <u>1.75 turns per histone</u>

#### Enzymatic digests

Particular enzymes can cut double stranded DNA between basepairs

Most of the enzymes have specific recognition sites

##### (1) MNase digests

Particular enzymes can cut double stranded DNA between  

+ **Micrococcal nuclease (MNase)** <u>cleaves everything</u> it can (no ⾮限制性 basepairs specific seq.) 

This micrococcal nuclease is a stable enzyme derived from Staphylococcus aureus. Micrococcal nuclease exhibits exo- and  endo-5'-phosphodiesterase activities against DNA and RNA. This enzyme digests double-stranded, single-stranded, circular and linear nucleic acids.

+ Micrococcal nuclease cuts accessible regions of DNA 

+ DNA protected by nucleosome is not cut

#### Structure of individual nucleosome

**Nucleosome** is the basic structural subunit of chromatin, consisting of ~200 bp of DNA, an octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4), and H1.

**Core DNA** is the 146 bp of DNA contained on a core particle.

**Linker DNA** is all DNA contained on a nucleosome <u>in excess of the 146 bp core DNA.</u> 

**Nucleosome core particle (NCP)** is the core including 146 bp DNA and histone octamer (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4)

Repeating structure contains 5 different proteins:

+ H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4 
  + Core structure formed from: H2A, H2B, H3, H4 **(Core histones)**
  + H1 is called the **linker histones** 
    + Binds to DNA in the linker region
    + Less tightly bound to DNA than core histones
    + May help compact adjacent nucleosomes

##### (1) The Connection Between Histone And DNA Molecular

The histone proteins are <u>basic</u>

+ They contain positively-charged amino acids
  + Lysine and Arginine
  + <u>H2A and H2B are more negatively-charged, Virus can use this site.</u>
+ They <u>binds to the phosphate group (Negatively-charged)</u> on the DNA molecular 

Histone has a globular domain and a flexible, charged amino acid terminus or ‘tail’

Epigenetic make modifications on the ‘tail’.

##### (2) Nonhistone proteins

## RNA Polynucleotide Chain Structure

Although usually single-stranded, RNA molecules can form short double-stranded regions

+ This secondary structure is due to complementary base-pairing
+ A to U and C to G
+ This allows short regions to form a double helix

<u>RNA helices are typically right-handed, 11-12 bases per turn in the A form</u>

### 1. Secondary Structure

### 2. Tertiary Structure
