# 一、Introduction

## A historical perspective on molecular biology

**1941** One gene encodes one protein (Beadle and Tatum).

**1944** DNA is the molecule that mediates heredity (Avery, MacLeod, & McCarty)

**1946** Genetic material can be transferred between bacterial cells (Lederberg & Tatum) 

**1950** In DNA, A = T, and C = G (Chargaff). 

**1952** DNA is the molecule that mediates heredity (Hershey & Chase). This confirmation of the 1944 results convinced everyone.

**1953** DNA is in the shape of a double helix with antiparallel nucleotide chains and specific base pairing. (Watson & Crick)

**1958** DNA replication is semi-conservative, (Meselson & Stahl)

**1959** Messenger RNA is the intermediate between DNA and protein.

**1966** The genetic code is cracked. 

**1970** The first restriction enzyme is purified by Hamilton Smith. 

**1972-73** Recombinant DNA is first constructed by Cohen & Boyer. 

**1977** DNA sequencing technology is developed by Fred Sanger.

**1986** PCR is developed by Kary Mullis.

**1990's** Genome projects begun. 



Rapid progress in molecular biology was and is made due to:
1. wise choices of relatively simple model organisms.
2. the development of biochemical and physical methods for studying specific molecules.
3. the widespread application of a set of logical principals for designing experiments and interpreting data.

## The Logic of Molecular Biology

1. Most biological processes work in the most efficient manner (**parsimony(节俭) & simplicity** are intuitively favorable).
2. Phylogeny matters – organisms are related and molecular mechanisms are **conserved.**
3. **Quantitative relationships** underlie most measurable phenomena.
4. **Conceptual models** can be used to understand molecular phenomena.
5. Data from simple **model systems** can be applied to complex organisms.
6. **Intuition** can be used to infer the best explanation, along with exclusion of all other reasonable possibilities (based on experimental data).
7. Optimism that **reductionist approaches** will solve higher-order problems.

## The idea of a “model system”
Model systems: 

+ used to study basic biological functions in a known organism. 
+ can be studied in diverse labs, with data transferable to other labs using the same system under the same conditions. 
+ discoveries have broad relevance in many related systems (e.g. basic functions in Arabidopsis are similar to those in maize). 
+ have one or more important features that made them so useful, such as a small genome, small size, fast reproduction time, or can be easily made transgenic using recombinant DNA techniques. 
+ Have a wealth of available data – such as genome sequence, methodologies, etc.

# 一、Some Important Discoveries

## Transfer of hereditary material

1928, Frederick Griffith shows that hereditary materials can be transferred from dead cells, using transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae

## One gene-one enzyme

1941, Beadle and Tatum (Beadle was trained as a maize geneticist) demonstrated the link between genes and proteins by showing that a single genetic mutation could block a single step in a metabolic pathway. 

1958 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

## Hershey-Chase

1952, the genetic material of a bacteria-infecting virus is DNA, not protein.
1969 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

## Watson & Crick – DNA has a double helix

1953, proposed double helix structure of DNA, based in part on X-ray diffraction performed by Rosalind Franklin (below)
