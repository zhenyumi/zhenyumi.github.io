# 一、Theories Explain Transmission of Hereditary Traits

## Theory of pangenesis (泛生论)

“Seeds” are produced by all parts of the body 

+ Collected in the reproductive organs 
+ Then transmitted to offspring at moment of conception

## Preformation Theory (先成论)

<u>People using early microscopes thought they saw a miniature human in the sperm</u>

With proper nourishment the miniature human unfolds into its adult proportions 

+ The Spermists believed the characteristics of the future person were found in the sperm 

+ The Ovists believed the characteristics of the future person resided in the egg

## Theory of Blending Inheritance(混合遗传)

The theory is that the progeny inherits any characteristic as the average of the parents' values of that characteristic. 

As an example of this a crossing of a red flower variety with a white variety of the same species would yield pink-flowered offspring.

# 二、Mendelian inheritance 孟德尔定律

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1567662750655.png" alt="1567662750655" style="zoom:100%;" />
## Principle of Dominance

<u>In heterozygote, one allele may hide the presence of another.</u>

## Mendel's First Law (The Principle of Segregation)

In a heterozygote, two different alleles segregate from each other during the formation of gametes.

Mendel's First Law: Allele Pairs Segregate（分离） during Gamete Formation.

Mendel's first law, or the **law of segregation**, which states that equal and independent segregation of alleles occurs during formation of gamete cells.

## Mendel's Second Law (The Principle of Independent Assortment)

The alleles of different genes assort independently of each other.

Mendel's Second Law: Different Genes Assort Independently during Gamete Formation.

Mendel's second law, or the **law of independent assortment**, states that different genes assort into gametes independently of one another.



## Exceptions to Mendel's Laws

### （1）Incomplete Dominance 不完全显性

Some alleles of a gene are neither dominant nor recessive. Instead, hybrid progeny（后代） **display a phenotype intermediate between those of the two parents.**

Examples：Flowering time；花色

### （2） Codominance 共显性

Recessive alleles often produce nonfunctional proteins, or none at all. However, there are many examples of two alleles of a gene that produce **two different functional proteins**, neither of which is dominant to the other.

Examples：血型

### （3）Linked Genes 基因连锁

Alleles for two different genes assort together in the gametes, rather than assorting independently. 

Genes that are close together on one chromosome are inherited together, contrary to Mendel's second law.

## Monohybrid Crosses

### （1）True breeding or pure breeding 纯系

A true-breeding plant is one that, when self-fertilized, only produces offspring with the same traits. True-breeding organisms are genetically identical and have identical alleles for specified traits. The alleles for these type of organisms are homozygous. 

### （2）Monohybrid cross 单基因杂交

genetic cross between <u>two true breeding individuals</u> with different alleles at one genetic locus of interest

+ One given trait/character is studied, which is controlled by a single gene locus. 
+ One parent having two dominant alleles and the other two recessives in this locus

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191116190547409.png" alt="image-20191116190547409" style="zoom:50%;" />

The approximately a 3:1 ratio between the dominant trait and the recessive trait <u>in F2</u> shows **The Principle of Segregation**.

## Dihybrid crosses 

Cross with two traits

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191116190525191.png" alt="image-20191116190525191" style="zoom:50%;" />

The 9:3:3:1 ratio in F2 shows **The Principle of Independent Assortment** and The alleles of different genes assort (segregate) independently of each other.

# 三、Probability

Mendel’s principles can be used to predict the outcomes of crosses between different strains of organisms

methods to predict outcomes 

+ The Punnett Square Method 

+ The Forked‐Line Method

## Sum Rule

如果事件A和B,are mutually exclusive，则:
$$
P(A\ or \ B) = P(A)+P(B)
$$

## Product Rule

If two events A and B are independent, then the probability of both events is the product of the probabilities for each event.
$$
P(A \text{ and }B) = P（A）\cdot P（B）
$$

## To Calculate the result

### （1）Punnett Square Method

### （2）The Forked-line Method 树形法、叉线法

## To Test the Accuracy of Expectation

### 1. The Chi Square Test

#### Method

A statistical method used to determine <u>goodness of fit</u> (适合度，适配度，拟合度）

<u>The chi square test does not prove that a hypothesis is correct</u>

It evaluates whether or not the data and the hypothesis have a good fit

The formula:
$$
X^2 = \sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}
$$
where
O = observed data in each category
E = expected data in each category based on the experimenter’s hypothesis
$\sum$ = Sum of the calculations for each category

#### To get the result

Compare the $X^2$and the critical value, 检验实验数据与实验假设是否符合

### （4）Pedigree Conventions

Mendelian Principles in Human Genetics has many obstacles:

1. Incomplete family records 

2. Not enough progeny 

3. Uncontrolled environment

Pedigrees are diagrams that <u>show the relationships among the members of a family.</u>

#### Inheritance of a Dominant Trait

+ Easy to identify 
+ Every individual who carries the dominant allele manifests the traits 

+ Dominant traits that are associated with reduced viability or fertility never become frequent in a population
+ Example: **Freckles** (雀斑)；**Widow’s peak** （美人尖）

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1569324481495.png" alt="1569324481495" style="zoom:33%;" />

#### Inheritance of a Recessive Trait

+ Difficult to identify 
+ Several generations are needed to trace the transmission of a receive allele
