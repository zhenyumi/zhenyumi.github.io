# 一、The Basic Processes of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis:


+ Provides carbohydrates for energy production

+ Fixes CO2 (carbon re-enters the biosphere)

+ The major source of atmospheric O2

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320170746273.png" alt="image-20200320170746273" style="zoom: 25%;" />

<u>Photosynthetic organisms first appeared approximately 3.4-2.3 billion years ago</u>

## The carbon cycle in nature

Carbon dioxide and water are combined through photosynthesis to form carbohydrates. 

In both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organisms these carbohydrates can be reoxidized to regenerate CO2 and H2O.

Part of the energy obtained from both photosynthesis and fuel oxidation is captured in ATP.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320170839280.png" alt="image-20200320170839280" style="zoom:100%;" />
Photosynthesis requires a <u>reductant</u>, usually <u>H2O (unlimited reducing equivalents), to reduce CO2 to the carbohydrate level.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320170934706.png" alt="image-20200320170934706" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ [CH2O] represents a general carbohydrate
+ CO2 is reduced to carbohydrate
+ H2A: a general reductant
+ A: oxidized product

## The role of photosynthesis in metabolism


The major biosynthetic pathways leading from carbon dioxide and water to polysaccharides are highlighted in <u>green</u>. 

<u>Oxygen derived from the water</u> is released as a <u>by-product</u> of photosynthesis.

It is more correct to write the photosynthetic reactions in the fashion shown in Table 16.1, which makes it clear that <u>one of the oxygens from CO2 ends up in carbohydrate, the other in water:</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320171402176.png" alt="image-20200320171402176" style="zoom:80%;" />

+ ^18^O-labelled H2O, unlabelled CO2;
+ Light energy cannot be used directly to drive this reaction;
+ H2O does not reduce CO2 directly under any circumstances;
+ The overall process is actually separated, both chemically and physically, into two subprocesses.

## The two subprocesses of photosynthesis


The overall process of photosynthesis is divided into **light reactions** and **dark reactions**. 

The **light reactions**, which require <u>visible light</u> as an energy source, produce <u>reducing power</u> (in the form of <u>NADPH), ATP, and O2.</u>

The <u>NADPH and ATP</u> drive the so-called **dark reactions,** which o<u>ccur in both the presence and the absence of light</u> and <u>fix CO2 into carbohydrates.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320171609668.png" alt="image-20200320171609668" style="zoom: 33%;" />

+ H2O is the electron donor

Dark reactions do not require direct light participation; accelerated by light 

# 二、The Chloroplast

**Chloroplasts (叶绿体)** are the photosynthetic organelles of green plants and algae. 

Several chloroplasts are shown in a cross section of a cell from a <u>Coleus（薄荷科植物）</u> leaf.

+ Under the leaf surface (mesophyll cells（叶肉细胞）)
+ Each cell has 20-50 chloroplasts
+ Semiautonomous, DNA, mRNA
+ Inner and outer membrane, stroma, stroma lamella, thylakoid, grana, lumen

## A photosynthetic **prokaryote**


This electron micrograph of a thin section of the **cyanobacterium（藻青菌）** A*nabaena azollae*（鱼腥藻） shows the <u>folded membranes</u>, which resemble the **thylakoids**（类囊体） of eukaryotic chloroplasts.

<u>Absorption of light and the light reactions occur in the chloroplast membranes.</u>

<u>The dark reactions occur in the stroma.</u>

# 三、The Light Reactions

## The energy of photons


The graph shows <u>energy per mole of photons</u> as a function of wavelength, compared with energies of several chemical bonds. 

Light in the ultraviolet range has enough energy to break <u>many chemical bonds</u> directly. 

Visible light can break <u>some weak bonds.</u> 

Light in the long-wavelength portion of <u>infrared</u> region of the spectrum causes <u>only heat-producing molecular vibrations.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320172617386.png" alt="image-20200320172617386" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Ozone layer blocks 97% far-ultraviolet; ozone depletion
+ Photosynthesis: visible + near - infrared (400-1000)

## Some photosynthetic pigments

<u>**Chlorophylls（叶绿素）** a and b</u> are the most abundant <u>plant and algal pigments</u>, whereas **β-carotene** and **phycocyanin（藻蓝蛋白）** are examples of <u>accessory pigments.</u> 

Phycocyanin and the related **phycoerythrin（藻红蛋白）** are open-chain tetrapyrroles that are covalently attached to **phycobiloproteins（藻胆蛋白）** via a sulfhydryl group, and they are abundant in <u>aquatic</u> photosynthetic organisms. 

<u>These pigments absorb strongly in the 500–600 nm range</u>, wavelengths that can efficiently pass through water. 

There are also bacteriochlorophylls, which differ slightly in structure. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320172923072.png" alt="image-20200320172923072" style="zoom:100%;" />
1. Absorption spectra and light energy

The absorption spectra of various plant pigments are compared with the spectral distribution of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320172956988.png" alt="image-20200320172956988" style="zoom:50%;" />

+ Chlorophyll a and b absorb strongly in both the deep blue and red, the light that is NOT absorbed but reflected from chloroplasts is green. The color of most growing plants;
+ The other observed colors, red, brown or purple—accessary pigments;
+ Loss of a and b in autumn leaves allows accessary pigments and nonphotosynthetic pigments to become evident, such as β-carotene.

## Two modes of energy transfer following photoexcitation 



1. In <u>**resonance transfer（共振转移）** molecule I</u> transfers its <u>excitation energy</u> to an <u>identical molecule II</u>, which rises to its higher energy state as molecule I falls back to the ground state. Resonance transfer is extraordinarily <u>fast</u>. 
2. In **electron transfer** an <u>excited electron</u> in molecule I is transferred to the <u>slightly lower</u> excited state of molecule II, making molecule I a <u>cation</u> and molecule II an <u>anion</u>.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320173402467.png" alt="image-20200320173402467" style="zoom:25%;" />

<u>Most chlorophyll molecules are used as antennae（天线） to catch photons and pass their energy on to reaction centers.</u>

Three-dimensional structure of the <u>trimeric light-harvesting complex II</u> of plants. 

The X-ray structure of the pea **LHCII** shows that the protein exists as a <u>homotrimer buried in the thylakoid membrane.</u> 

<u>Each trimer contains 24 chlorophyll a molecules, 18 chlorophyll b molecules, and 12 carotenoids（类胡萝卜素）</u> (luteins and xanthophylls), all serving as <u>antenna</u> molecules. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320173644262.png" alt="image-20200320173644262" style="zoom:33%;" />

### 1. Resonance transfer of energy in a light-harvesting complex: 

The <u>excitation energy</u> originating in a <u>photon</u> of light <u>wanders（徘徊，漫步）</u> from <u>one antenna molecule to another</u> until it reaches a <u>reaction center.</u> 

There an <u>electron is transferred</u> to a <u>primary electron acceptor molecule, and the energy is trapped.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320173845833.png" alt="image-20200320173845833" style="zoom: 50%;" />

<u>Two photosystems, linked in series</u>, are involved in the photosynthetic light reactions in <u>algae, cyanobacteria, and higher plants</u>.

In each of the two photosystems, the primary step is <u>transfer of a light-excited electron from a reaction center (P680 or P700) into an electron transport chain.</u>

The <u>ultimate source of the electrons</u> is the <u>water molecules producing O2.</u> 

---

The <u>final destination of the electrons</u> is the molecule of **NADP^+^**, which is thereby reduced to **NADPH**.

<u>At two stages in the electron transport process, protons are released into the thylakoid (类囊体) lumen.</u> 

<u>Some of the protons come from the H2O</u> that is broken down, <u>some come from the stroma.</u>

This transfer of protons into the lumen produces a <u>pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane.</u> 

Thus, <u>ATP and reducing power in the form of NADPH (reducing equivalent) are the products of the light reactions.</u> 

These compounds are exactly what is needed to <u>drive the syntheses carried out in the dark reactions.</u>

Electrons taken from water in PSII are transferred to PSI via plastoquinone (Q), cyt b6f complex, and plastocyanin (PC, 质体蓝素). In PSI, electrons are excited again by photon (light) for transfer via a series of intermediates to ferredoxin and reduced ferredoxin reduces NADP+ to NADPH.

## A model for the catalytic function of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) cluster in PSII

<u>S0  -  S4 represent the different oxidation states that the ligated metal cluster cycles through as e - and H+ are abstracted from the H2O molecules.</u> 

In the first four transitions, <u>light energy</u> is used to oxidize <u>P680 to P680+</u>, which in turn <u>oxidizes the metal-oxo cluster</u> of the OEC.

The <u>S~0~ → S~4~</u> transition is light-independent and releases O2. Thus, <u>four photons are required to oxidize two H2O to one O2.</u>

#### Detailed Process

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320175655748.png" alt="image-20200320175655748" style="zoom:100%;" />
In this proposed mechanism, **Y~Z~** represents the <u>redox-active tyrosine residue of the D1 subunit</u>; the <u>oxidized form of Y~Z~ is the neutral, deprotonated radical species, Y~Z~.</u> 

The <u>two H2O molecules are bound in the S~0~Y~Z~ state by the Ca^2+^ ion and the “dangler” Mn^III^ ion.</u> 

Each <u>transition passes</u> through an <u>intermediate S~n~Y~Z~</u> , in which the <u>oxidized tyrosine is poised to oxidize the metal cluster of the OEC</u>, but for clarity, the tyrosine radical is shown only once. 

In this model, only <u>two of the Mn ions change their oxidation states.</u> 

The <u>S4→S4’</u> transition is the crucial <u>O-O bond-forming</u> step and involves <u>the attack by a calcium-bound water upon the electrophilic Mn^V^=O oxo group. O2 is released</u>, and two new H2O are bound to initiate another cycle.

+ Mn价态的改变最终使得H2O splitting

#### Simple Summary

The system has in effect <u>stripped four electrons from the four hydrogen atoms in two water molecules.</u> 

The **oxygen** produced diffuses out of the chloroplast. 

The **four protons** that are produced from the two water molecules are released into the **thylakoid lumen**, helping to generate a pH difference between the lumen and stroma.

We may summarize the reaction carried out by **photosystem II** as follows:

However, there is <u>only one kind of reaction center, water is not split</u>, and <u>electron flow is cyclic.</u>

## Schematic view of the Calvin cycle

1. **Stage I**  -  <u>CO2 is fixed</u> and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <u>(GAP) is produced</u>. 
 + Part of this GAP is used to make <u>hexose phosphates</u> and eventually <u>polysaccharides</u>. 

2. **Stage II**  -  another fraction of the GAP is used to <u>generate</u> the acceptor molecule, <u>ribulose-1,5-BP.</u>



### 1. Stage I: Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Sugar Production


CO2 is incorporated into **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).** 

The <u>acceptor molecule</u> for CO2 is **ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)**. （1,5-二磷酸核酮糖）

CO2 from the air diffuses into the <u>stroma</u> of the chloroplast, where it is added at the carbonyl carbon of RuBP. 

The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme **ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase**, also known as **ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (or rubisco)**. 

This enzyme is one of the <u>most important</u> in the biosphere and certainly the most abundant. It makes up about <u>15% of all chloroplast proteins</u>, and there are an estimated <u>40 million tons</u> of it in the world—about <u>20 pounds</u> for every living person.

## The Dark Reactions: The Calvin Cycle

The <u>carboxylase reaction</u> is a complex series of steps in which the <u>actual acceptor</u> is proposed to be the five-carbon **enediolate** intermediate:

### 1. Active site of rubisco

This model is based on the X-ray structure of spinach rubisco complexed with Mg2+ and the transition-state analog 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate (2CABP).

Each molecule of **3PG** is phosphorylated by ATP, in a reaction catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase. 

The **1,3-bisphosphoglycerate** so produced is then reduced to g**lyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP)**, with accompanying loss of one phosphate.

The <u>reducing agent is NADPH</u>, produced in the light reaction, and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase:

### 2. Stoichiometry of the Calvin cycle


In six turns of the Calvin cycle, <u>6 CO2</u> molecules will have entered and bound to <u>6 RuBP to yield 12 GAP</u>. 

Because **GAP** is in isomeric equilibrium with **DHAP**, the 12 GAP may be considered an <u>interconvertible</u> stock of 12 (GAP-DHAP). 

Of these, <u>6</u> are used to make **3 FBP**, of which <u>one</u> constitutes the <u>net hexose</u> product of the 6 turns. 

The other <u>2 FBPs</u> are used, together with the <u>6 remaining molecules of (GAP-DHAP), to form 6 Ru5P</u>, which are then phosphorylated to <u>regenerate</u> the required <u>6 RuBP.</u>

### 3. Regeneration phase of the Calvin cycle: 

Note the similarity of this pathway to parts of the **pentose phosphate pathway** running in reverse

### 4. Stage II: Regeneration of the Acceptor

The reactions we have considered to this point can account for the introduction of one carbon into one molecule of hexose, with subsequent formation of oligosaccharides or polysaccharides.

To complete the Calvin cycle, it is necessary to <u>regenerate enough RuBP to keep the cycle going.</u> 

This means we will need to regenerate <u>6 moles of RuBP</u> for <u>every 6 moles of CO2 taken up.</u> 

This is accomplished by the set of reactions, which constitute the <u>regenerative phase</u> of the cycle.

Note that the <u>input molecules</u> in this somewhat complex reaction pathway are as follows:

1. <u>Two</u> molecules of **DHAP** and <u>four</u> molecules of **GAP**, from the six GAP that were diverted to the regeneration pathway.
2. <u>Two</u> of the <u>three</u> molecules of fructose-6-phosphate (**F6P**) that were produced from the remaining three GAP and three DHAP.

**Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase （rubisco）** is a <u>peculiar enzyme.</u> 

Under normal environmental conditions, it can behave as an **oxygenase** as well as a **carboxylase**. 

In the oxygenase reaction, it is proposed that the **enediolate intermediate** nucleophilically <u>attacks O2 instead of CO2.</u>

+ CO2 is low and O2 is high (normal air)
+ Km for O2 (21%) is about 10-fold higher than for CO2 (about 0.04%)
+ In chloroplast

+ A wasteful process that costs ATP and limits the carbon assimilation by the plant (“flaw design” :
 + RuBP is lost from the Calvin cycle;
 + The fixation of CO2 is reversed; 
 + O2 is consumed;CO2 is released
 + Only a part (75%) of the carbon is returned to the chloroplast 
 + ATP is expended 
+ Evolution can only work with what it has at hand (about 3 billion yrs ago: O2 is very low, oxygenation activity is negligible).
+ As O2 levels (21%) increased, oxygenase activity became significant).
+ Modify the rubisco during evolution? Not much
+ Can we engineer an more efficient Rubisco 
+ Enzyme? Not successful yet.

# 六、Photorespiration and the C4 Cycle

## The C4 Cycle

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200320184238606.png" alt="image-20200320184238606" style="zoom:100%;" />
**C4 plants**: a plant that utilizes the **C4 carbon fixation** pathway in which the **CO2** is first bound to a **phosphoenolpyruvate** in **mesophyll cell (叶肉细胞)** resulting in the formation of four-carbon compound (**oxaloacetate**) that is shuttled to the **bundle sheath cell** where it will be decarboxylated to liberate the **CO2** to be utilized in the <u>C3 pathway.</u>

C4 plants (maize, sugarcane): 

+ tropical plants;
+ High illumination, high temperature, CO2 deletion;
+ CO2 concentrating mechanism（浓缩了二氧化碳）
+ Help fix CO2 from photorespiration
+ PEP carboxylase: <u>no oxygenase activity</u>（避免了光呼吸的低效率）; low Km for CO2
