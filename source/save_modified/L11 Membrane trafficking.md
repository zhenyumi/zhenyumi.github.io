## What is membrane trafficking

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323215441466.png" alt="image-20200323215441466" style="zoom:80%;" />

Membrane trafficking is the process by which proteins, pathogens, and other macromolecules are distributed throughout the cell, and released to or internalised from the extracellular space.

Membrane trafficking uses membrane-bound vesicles as transport intermediaries.

This transport can take place within different organelles in the same cell, or across the cell membrane to and from the extracellular environment.

**Membrane trafficking mediates the biosynthetic-secretory and endocytic pathways**：

> This vesicular traffic flows along highly organized, directional routes, which allow the cell to <u>secrete, eat, and remodel its plasma membrane and organelles.</u>

## Transport directions: exocytosis (secretion) *vs* endocytosis

# 一、Vesicular transport

## Vesicular transport consists of budding, targeting and fusion

Vesicles are membrane bound transport intermediates.

Principle: The orientation of the membrane and of membrane proteins does not change during vesicular transport processes.

Transport vesicles

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323215754602.png" alt="image-20200323215754602" style="zoom:67%;" />

+ How are vesicles formed? 

+ How are vesicles budded from the original membrane?

+ How does vesicle fusion occur? 

+ How is the whole process regulated?

### 1. Genetic analysis using yeast temperature-sensitive mutants

Multicopy suppression

+ First, a known key gene for vesicular transport is mutated; to bypass this defect, an interacting protein that is produced to higher amounts will bind to the mutant protein vividly, to cure this defect. 
+ This is through library screening after transfecting of randomized plasmids into mutant yeast cells.
+ Through this screening, important binding partners for a known vesicular transport protein can be identified.

### 2. Using biochemistry to study “vesicles”

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220032332.png" alt="image-20200323220032332" style="zoom:100%;" />
## The player in vesicle formation

Transport vesicles are characterized by a specific set of “coat” proteins, which drive formation of the vesicles.

What do vesicles need coat proteins?

Coat proteins perform two distinct functions: 

+ Inner layer: cargo recognition and concentration
+ Outer layer: membrane deformation to generate a free vesicle

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220107132.png" alt="image-20200323220107132" style="zoom:45%;" />

There are many players along vesicle-mediated transport: coat proteins, proteins functioning in vesicle fission, tether factor, motor molecules, proteins functioning in membrane fusion…

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220137980.png" alt="image-20200323220137980" style="zoom:100%;" />
### 1. Various types of coated vesicles

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220213643.png" alt="image-20200323220213643" />

> The coat performs two main functions that are reflected in a common two-layered structure
>
> 1. First, an inner coat layer <u>**concentrates** specific membrane proteins in a **specialized patch**</u>, which then gives rise to the vesicle membrane. In this way, <u>the inner layer selects the appropriate membrane molecules for transport.</u> 
> 2. Second, an outer coat layer <u>assembles into a curved, basketlike lattice that **deforms** the membrane</u> patch and thereby shapes the vesicle

#### The three major transport vesicles mediate transport

> There are three well-characterized types of coated vesicles, distinguished by their major coat proteins: **clathrin-coated,** **COPI-coated**, and **COPII-coated**

Clathrin: transport proteins from the plasma membrane (endocytosis) and anterograde from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to early and late endosomes.

> Both cis and trans faces are closely associated with special compartments, each composed of a network of <u>interconnected tubular and cisternal structures</u>: the **cis Golgi network (CGN)** and the **trans Golgi network (TGN)**, respectively

> **Clathrin-coated vesicles**, for example, mediate transport <u>from the Golgi apparatus and from the plasma membrane</u>, whereas **COPI and COPII-coated** vesicles most commonly mediate transport <u>from the ER and from the Golgi cisternae</u> 

COP (coat-protein) I: Transport proteins in the <u>retrograde</u> direction between Golgi cisternae and retrograde from the cis-Golgi back to the ER (retrieval).

COP (coat-protein) II: Transport proteins from the ER to the cis-Golgi

> **COPI-coated vesicles** and **COPII-coated vesicles** transport material early in the secretory pathway: COPI-coated vesicles <u>bud from Golgi compartments</u>, and COPII-coated vesicles <u>bud from the ER</u>

##### (1) Clathrin-coated pits and budding of CCVs at the PM

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220359262.png" alt="image-20200323220359262" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### (2) Clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)

> The major protein component of clathrin-coated vesicles is **clathrin (网格蛋白)** itself, which forms the outer layer of the coat. Each clathrin subunit consists of <u>three large and three small polypeptide chains</u> that together form a <u>three-legged structure called a **triskelion**</u>
>
> Clathrin triskelions assemble into a basketlike framework of hexagons and pentagons to form coated pits (buds) on the cytosolic surface of membranes (Figure 13–7). Under appropriate conditions, isolated triskelions spontaneously self-assemble into typical polyhedral cages in a test tube, even in the absence of the membrane vesicles that these baskets normally enclose (Figure 13–6C,D). Thus, the clathrin triskelions determine the geometry of the clathrin cage (Figure 13–6E).

“Clathrin” consists of 3 large and 3 small polypeptide chains, which assemble into a “three-legged” triskelion 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220503879.png" alt="image-20200323220503879" style="zoom:80%;" />

+ How would you call a protein complex that consists of 3 large and 3 small subunits?

##### (3) Clathrin-coated vesicle assembly and disassembly

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220839504.png" alt="image-20200323220839504" style="zoom:100%;" />
> **Clathrin-coated vesicles**, the first coated vesicles to be identified, transport material <u>from the plasma membrane and between endosomal and Golgi compartments.</u>

+ Coat proteins sort the cargo proteins into the budding vesicle:
 + They link cargo selection to vesicle formation
 + Is it possible to form vesicles without cargo? 

Questions related to vesicle-mediated transport:

+ How to control when and where to form vesicles?
+ How is membrane curvature induced?
+ How are vesicles pinched-off (vesicle fission)?
+ How are vesicles fused with target membrane (vesicle fusion)?

### 2. How are the cargo proteins recognized and packaged?  -  - adaptor protein (AP) complexes

> **Adaptor proteins**, another major coat component in clathrin-coated vesicles, form a discrete inner layer of the coat, <u>positioned between the clathrin cage and the membrane</u>
>
> They <u>bind the clathrin coat to the membrane</u> and <u>trap various transmembrane proteins</u>, including transmembrane receptors that capture soluble cargo molecules inside the vesicle—so-called **cargo receptors.**
>
> In this way, the adaptor proteins select a specific set of transmembrane proteins, together with the soluble proteins that interact with them,

> Each type of adaptor protein is specific for a different set of cargo receptors. Clathrin-coated vesicles budding <u>from different membranes</u> use <u>different adaptor proteins</u> and thus package different receptors and cargo molecules

CCV cargo is recognized by tetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220544106.png" alt="image-20200323220544106" style="zoom:100%;" />


AP complexes:

+ hetero-tetramer (4 different subunits, termed adaptins)
 + 2 large subunits (α-/β-adaptin) 
 + 1 medium subunit (μ-adaptin) 
 + 1 small subunit (σ-adaptin) 

+ 5 different APs exist
 + each of the 5 APs has its unique composition

+ Bind to membranes, to cargo and to clathrin

APs are the central link between membrane, cargo & clathrin

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323220800456.png" alt="image-20200323220800456" style="zoom:100%;" />
#### phospholipids

Membranes contain a mix of phospholipids and each leaflet has a different phospholipid composition (Lecture 5)

+ Membrane contains many different types of phospholipids
+ Different types of phospholipids located <u>unevenly</u> between two layers

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221140290.png" alt="image-20200323221140290" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Different head groups of phospholipid allow specific interaction with proteins:

+ Phosphatidylinositol (PI) at the <u>inner/cytosolic</u> leaflet: phosphorylation of PI by <u>protein kinases</u>.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221243548.png" alt="image-20200323221243548" />

#### AP complexes bind to phospholipids and to cargo protein

> The adaptor protein **AP2** serves as a well-understood example
>
> When it binds to a specific <u>phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipid (a phosphoinositide),</u> it <u>alters its conformation</u>, <u>exposing binding sites for cargo receptors in the membrane</u>. The simultaneous binding to the cargo receptors and lipid head groups greatly <u>enhances the binding of **AP2** to the membrane</u>
>
> + Because several requirements must be met simultaneously to stably bind AP2 proteins to a membrane, the proteins act as **coincidence detectors** that only assemble at the right time and place
>
> Upon binding, they **induce membrane curvature**, which makes the binding of additional AP2 proteins in its proximity more likely. The **cooperative assembly** of the AP2 coat layer then is further <u>amplified by clathrin binding</u>, which leads to the formation and budding of a transport vesicle
>
> + Adaptor proteins found in other coats also bind to **phosphoinositides** which not only have a major role in directing when and where coats assemble in the cell, but also are used much more widely as <u>molecular markers</u> of <u>compartment identity</u>. This helps to control vesicular traffic,

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221310922.png" alt="image-20200323221310922" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Lipid-induced conformation switch of AP2 to “open” the binding pocket

**Reaction sequence:**

1. Membrane binding to open the binding pocket for the cargo interaction

2. Cargo binding

3. Clathrin recruitment

#### Subcellular localization of phosphoinositides (PIPs)

> PI can undergo rapid cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the 3ʹ, 4ʹ, and 5ʹ positions of their inositol sugar head groups to produce various types of **phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol phosphates, or PIPs)**
>
> The interconversion of **phosphatidylinositol** (PI) and **PIPs** is highly <u>compartmentalized</u>: different organelles in the endocytic and secretory pathways have <u>distinct sets of PI and PIP kinases</u> and <u>PIP phosphatases</u> (Figure 13–10). 
>
> + The distribution, regulation, and local balance of these enzymes determine the steady-state distribution of each PIP species. 

> Many proteins involved at different steps in vesicle transport contain domains that bind with **high specificity** to the **head groups of particular PIPs**
>
> Local control of the **PI and PIP kinases** and **PIP phosphatases** can therefore be used to rapidly control the binding of proteins to a membrane or membrane domain. The production of a particular type of PIP **recruits** proteins containing matching PIP-binding domains

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221438867.png" alt="image-20200323221438867" style="zoom:80%;" />

Differentially located phosphoinositides (PIPs) regulate vesicular transport

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221509551.png" alt="image-20200323221509551" style="zoom:100%;" />
Specific phosphoinositides mark compartments and membrane domains

Specificity of vesicle formation by PIPs:

+ Secretory vesicles (SVs) contain <font color="DD0000">PI(4)P</font>, after fusion with PM, a PM-localizing **PI5-kinase** converts <font color="DD0000">PI(4)P</font> to <font color="DD0000">PI(4,5)P2</font>
+ <font color="DD0000">PI(4,5)P2</font> **recruits** the AP complex for the formation of endocytic CCVs
+ After CCV budding, a cytosolic **PI(5)P phosphatase** hydrolyses <font color="DD0000">PI(4,5)P2</font>, which promotes uncoating of the vesicle 

> As a clathrin-coated bud grows, soluble cytoplasmic proteins, including **dynamin**, assemble at the **neck of each bud**
>
> **Dynamin** contains a **PI(4,5)** **P~2~-binding domain**, which tethers the protein to the membrane, and a **GTPase domain**, which regulates the **rate** at which vesicles <u>pinch off from the membrane.</u>
>
> The pinching-off process brings the two noncytosolic leaflets of the membrane into <u>close proximity</u> and <u>fuses</u> them, sealing off the forming vesicle
>
> + To perform this task, **dynamin** <u>recruits other proteins to the neck of the bud</u>. Together with **dynamin**, they help <u>bend the patch of membrane</u>—by directly <u>distorting the bilayer structure</u>, or by <u>changing its lipid composition</u> through the recruitment of <u>**lipid-modifying enzymes**</u>, or by both mechanisms.
>
> Once released from the membrane, the vesicle <u>rapidly loses its clathrin coat.</u> A **PIP phosphatase** that is **co-packaged** into clathrin-coated vesicles <u>depletes</u> <font color="DD0000">**PI(4,5) P~2~**</font> from the membrane, which <u>weakens the binding of the adaptor proteins</u>. 
>
> + In addition, an **hsp70** chaperone protein (see Figure 6–80) functions as an **uncoating ATPase**, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to peel off（剥离） the clathrin coat. 
> + **Auxilin**, another vesicle protein, is thought to activate the ATPase

#### Trigger Vesicle Formation

Vesicle formation triggered by small GTP-binding proteins (small G-proteins or GTPases)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221658623.png" alt="image-20200323221658623" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### (1) Small G-proteins

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221726741.png" alt="image-20200323221726741" style="zoom:100%;" />
##### (2) Assembly and disassembly of coat by GTPases

> While <u>local production of PIPs</u> plays a major part in regulating the assembly of clathrin coats on the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus, cells superimpose additional ways of regulating coat formation
>
> **Coat-recruitment GTPases**, for example, control the assembly of clathrin coats on endosomes and the COPI and COPII coats on Golgi and ER membranes.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323221753272.png" alt="image-20200323221753272" style="zoom:80%;" />

> GTP-binding proteins regulate most processes <u>in eukaryotic cells</u>. They act as **molecular switches**, which <u>flip between an active state with GTP bound and an inactive state with GDP bound</u>
>
> Two classes of proteins regulate the flipping: **guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)** activate the proteins by <u>catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP,</u> and **GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)** inactivate the proteins by <u>triggering the hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP</u>
>
> Both monomeric GTP-binding proteins (**monomeric GTPases**) and **trimeric** GTP-binding proteins (**G proteins**) have important roles in vesicle transport

> **Coat-recruitment GTPases** are members of a family of **monomeric GTPases**. They include the <font color="EE0000">**ARF proteins**</font>, which are responsible for the assembly of both **COPI and clathrin coats** assembly at Golgi membranes, and the <font color="EE0000">**Sar1 protein**</font>, which is responsible for the assembly of **COPII coats at the ER membrane**.
>
> + When a COPII-coated vesicle is to bud from the ER membrane, for example, a specific <font color="EE0000">**Sar1-GEF**</font> embedded in the ER membrane binds to <font color="EE0000">**cytosolic Sar1**</font>, causing the Sar1 to release its GDP and bind GTP in its place
>
> + GTP is present in much higher concentration in the cytosol than GDP and therefore will spontaneously bind after GDP is released.) In its GTP-bound state, the **Sar1 protein** <u>exposes an **amphiphilic helix**</u>, which inserts into the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the ER membrane. The tightly bound **Sar1** now <u>recruits adaptor coat protein subunits</u> to the ER membrane to initiate budding
>
> <u>The coat-recruitment GTPases also have a role in **coat disassembly**.</u> The hydrolysis of bound <u>GTP to GDP causes the GTPase to change its conformation</u> so that its hydrophobic <u>tail **pops out of the membrane**</u>, causing the vesicle’s coat to disassemble. Although it is not known what triggers the GTP hydrolysis, it has been proposed that the <u>GTPases work like timers</u>
>
> + COPII coats accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Sar1, and a fully formed vesicle will be produced only when bud formation occurs <u>faster</u> than the timed disassembly process;
>
> Once a vesicle pinches off, GTP hydrolysis releases Sar1, but the sealed coat is sufficiently stabilized through many **cooperative interactions**, including <u>binding to the cargo receptors in the membrane</u>, that it may stay on the vesicle <u>until the vesicle docks at a target membrane</u>. There, a **kinase phosphorylates** the coat proteins, which completes coat disassembly and readies the vesicle for fusion
>
> **Clathrin - and COPI-coated vesicles**, by contrast, shed their coat soon <u>after they pinch off.</u> For COPI vesicles, the **curvature** of the vesicle membrane serves as a trigger to <u>begin uncoating</u>. An <font color="EE0000">**ARF-GAP**</font> is recruited to the COPI coat as it assembles. It interacts with the membrane, and <u>senses</u> the **lipid packing density**. It becomes activated when the curvature of the membrane approaches that of a transport vesicle. It then inactivates ARF, causing the coat to disassemble

**Coat-recruitment GTPases**: 

+ **ARF** (ADP-ribosylation factor) <u>GTPases</u>
 + COPI
 + clathrin

+ **Sar** (secretion-associated Ras-superfamily related protein) <u>1 GTPase</u>
 + COPII

+ GTPase works like a timer and cause disassembly shortly after the budding is completed

IMPORTANT POINTS

+ Assembly of coat proteins induces curvature in membrane and eventual budding

### 3. Tubular vesicles

Vesicles are not all spherical, and can be large irregular vesicle or tubule. 

> Not All Transport Vesicles Are Spherical
>
> vesicle-budding from many intracellular membranes occurs <u>preferentially at regions where the membranes are already curved</u>
>
> Transport vesicles also occur in various sizes and shapes. Diverse COPII vesicles are required for the transport of large cargo molecules.
>
> + **Collagen**, for example, is assembled in the ER as <u>300-nm-long</u>, stiff procollagen rods that then are secreted from the cell where they are cleaved by proteases to collagen, which is embedded into the extracellular matrix
> + **Procollagen** rods do not fit into the <u>60–80 nm COPII vesicles</u> normally observed. To circumvent this problem, the procollagen cargo molecules bind to transmembrane **packaging proteins** in the ER, which control the assembly of the COPII coat components

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200323223519118.png" alt="image-20200323223519118" style="zoom:67%;" />

> Tubules have a higher **surface-to-volume ratio** than the larger organelles from which they form
>
> + They are therefore relatively enriched in membrane proteins compared with soluble cargo proteins. As we discuss later, this property of tubules is <u>an important feature for sorting proteins in endosomes</u>

### 4. Multiple factors control when and where to assemble coat proteins

Multiple factors confer location-specificity:

+ Presence of specific phosphoinositides (PIPs) within a respective membrane of a cellular compartment can <u>trigger coat recruitment</u>
+ Activation and recruitment of coat-recruiting GTPases:
 + **ARF** (ADP-ribosylation factor) <u>GTPases</u>: 
 + responsible for clathrin coat assembly and for COP I coat assembly
 + **Sar** (secretion-associated <font color="EE0000">Ras</font>-superfamily related protein) <u>1 GTPases</u>
 + Responsible for COP II coat assembly

### 5. Membrane-bending

How to apply force to a lipid bilayer:

+ Membrane-bending proteins help deform the membrane during vesicle formation
+ Cytoplasmic proteins can regulate the pinching-off and uncoating of coated vesicles

> Membrane-Bending Proteins Help Deform the Membrane During Vesicle Formation
>
> The forces generated by clathrin coat assembly alone are **not sufficient** to shape and pinch off a vesicle from the membrane. **Other membrane-bending and force-generating protein**s participate at every stage of the process.
>
> Membrane-bending proteins that contain **crescent-shaped domains**, called **BAR domains,** bind to and impose their shape on the underlying membrane via **electrostatic interactions** with the **lipid head groups**
>
> Some of these proteins also contain **amphiphilic helices** that <u>induce membrane curvature</u> after being inserted as <u>wedges into the cytoplasmic leaflet</u> of the membrane.
>
> Finally, the clathrin machinery <u>nucleates the local assembly of **actin filaments**</u> that <u>introduce tension to help pinch off</u> and propel the forming vesicle away from the membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324135056549.png" alt="image-20200324135056549" style="zoom:100%;" />
Membrane-bending proteins help deform the membrane during vesicle formation: **BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs)** domains: 

+ coiled-coils that dimerize
+ BAR domain-containing proteins are curved
+ dimers have positively charged inner surface
+ dimers interact/associate with negatively charged lipid headgroups
+ induce curvature of membranes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324135139339.png" alt="image-20200324135139339" style="zoom:80%;" />

## Fission of the vesicle

Fission of the vesicle: **Dynamin** assists!

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324135443309.png" alt="image-20200324135443309" style="zoom: 50%;" />

Dynamin: 

+ <font color="EE0000">PI(4,5)-P2</font>-binding domain tethers the protein to the membrane.
+ GTPase domain regulates the rate of budding

### 1. Dynamin mediated budding of vesicles

Conformational changes in the GTPase domains of membrane-assembled dynamin drives a conformational change that constricts the neck of the bud

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324135813099.png" alt="image-20200324135813099" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Dynamin pinches off CCVs at the PM

Deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits form in the nerve endings of fly’s nerve cells, with a belt of mutant dynamin assembled around the neck

### 2. Targeted to specific sites for fusion

<font color="EE0000">Rabs</font> and <font color="EE0000">SNAREs</font> mediate the specificity during vesicle targeting and membrane fusion events: → recognition of the target membrane

SNARE proteins: soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor)

1. Exhibit specific subcellular distribution

#### Rab protein family: monomeric GTPases

> <font color="EE0000">Rab</font> Proteins Guide Transport Vesicles to Their Target Membrane
>
> To ensure an orderly flow of vesicle traffic, transport vesicles must be highly accurate in recognizing the correct target membrane with which to fuse. 
>
> <u>Because of the **diversity and crowding of membrane systems** in the cytoplasm, a vesicle is likely to encounter many **potential target membranes** before it finds the correct one.</u> 
>
> Specificity in targeting is ensured because <u>all transport vesicles display **surface markers**</u> that identify them <u>according to their origin and type of cargo</u>, and target membranes display **complementary receptors** that recognize the appropriate markers. This crucial process occurs in two steps. 
>
> First, <font color="EE0000">Rab proteins</font> and <font color="EE0000">Rab effectors</font> <u>direct the vesicle to specific spots on the correct target membrane.</u> 
>
> + Rab proteins are also **monomeric GTPases**
>
> Second, <font color="EE0000">SNARE proteins</font> and <font color="EE0000">SNARE regulators</font> <u>mediate the fusion of the lipid bilayers</u>

> Their **highly selective distribution** on these membrane systems makes Rab proteins be able for identifying each membrane type and guiding vesicle traffic between them. Rab proteins can function on transport vesicles, on target membranes, or both

Monomeric GTPases with specific subcellular localizations

60 family members, each associates with one or more compartments of the biosynthetic secretory or endocytic pathways.

| Protein | Organelle             |
|  - -------- - |  - -------------------------------------------------------- - |
| Rab1  | ER and Golgi complex          |
| Rab2  | *cis* Golgi network          |
| Rab3A  | Synaptic vesicles, secretory vesicles      |
| Rab4/Rab11 | Recycling endosomes          |
| Rab5  | Early endosomes, plasma membrane, clathrin-coated vesicles |
| Rab6  | Medial and *trans* Golgi         |
| Rab7  | Late endosomes            |

#### Rab GTPases are key players in membrane trafficking processes

> Like the coat-recruitment GTPases, Rab proteins <u>**cycle between** a membrane \and the cytosol</u> and <u>regulate the reversible assembly of protein complexes on the membrane</u>. In their **GDP-bound state**, they are inactive and bound to another protein <font color="EE0000">(**Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor, or GDI**)</font> that keeps them <u>soluble</u> in the cytosol; in their **GTP-bound state**, they are <u>active</u> and tightly <u>associated with the membrane of an organelle or transport vesicle.</u> 
>
> Membrane-bound **Rab-GEFs** <u>activate Rab proteins on both transport vesicle and target membranes</u>; for some membrane fusion events, activated Rab molecules are required on both sides of the reaction. Once in the **GTP-bound state** and membrane-bound through a **now-exposed lipid anchor**, Rab proteins bind to other proteins, called <font color="EE0000">Rab effectors</font>, which are the downstream mediators of <u>vesicle transport</u>, <u>membrane tethering,</u> and <u>membrane fusion</u> (Figure 13–16). 
>
> The **rate of GTP hydrolysis** sets the <u>concentration of active Rab</u> and, consequently, the <u>concentration of its effectors on the membrane</u>
>
> The same Rab proteins can often bind to many different effectors. Some Rab effectors are **motor proteins** that propel vesicles along **actin filaments** or **microtubules** to their target membrane. Others are **tethering proteins**, some of which have long, threadlike domains that serve as “fishing lines” that can extend to link two membranes more than 200 nm apart;

Another GTP-switch: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324140533628.png" alt="image-20200324140533628" style="zoom:100%;" />
1. Rab-GDP is inactive and cytosolic, usually bound to Rab-GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI)
2. Activated by membrane-bound Rab-GEF (Guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and becomes Rab-GTP (active form)
3. Once in active form, Rab-GTP exposes hydrophobic anchor to be membrane-bound and recruits other proteins e.g. Rab effectors

Recognizing the target membrane: tethering → docking → fusion: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324140843013.png" alt="image-20200324140843013" style="zoom:67%;" />

+ Activated Rab and Rab effectors tether
+ SNARES trigger specific fusion 
+ GDI: (GDP dissociation inhibitor)

> The tethering complex that docks COPII-coated vesicles, for example, contains a **protein kinase** that <u>phosphorylates</u> the coat proteins to complete the uncoating process
>
> <u>Coupling uncoating to vesicle delivery</u> helps to ensure directionality of the transport process and fusion with the proper membrane.

#### The formation of a <font color="EE0000">Rab5</font> domain on the endosomal membrane

> <font color="EE0000">**Rab5**</font>, for example, assembles on endosomes and mediates the capture of endocytic vesicles arriving from the plasma membrane.
>
> A **Rab5** domain concentrates tethering proteins that catch incoming vesicles. Its assembly on endosomal membranes begins when a **Rab5-GDP/GDI complex** encounters a **Rab-GEF**. <u>GDI is released and **Rab5-GDP** is converted to **Rab5-GTP**.</u> 
>
> + **Active Rab5-GTP** becomes anchored to the membrane and <u>recruits more Rab5-GEF to the endosome,</u> thereby stimulating the recruitment of more Rab5 to the same site. In addition, active Rab5 activates a **PI 3-kinase**, which locally <u>converts **PI** to <font color="EE0000">**PI(3)P**</font></u>, which <u>in turn binds some of the **Rab effectors**</u> including tethering proteins and <u>stabilizes their local membrane attachment</u>
>
> Thus, while the **Rab5** <u>membrane domain</u> receives incoming endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, distinct <font color="EE0000">**Rab11**</font> and <font color="EE0000">**Rab4**</font> domains in the same membrane <u>organize the budding of recycling vesicles</u> that return proteins from the endosome to the plasma membrane.

Formation of a Rab5 domain:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324140947539.png" alt="image-20200324140947539" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ activation and recruitment of Rab5-GTP
+ recruitment of PI3-kinase to generate PI(3)P
+ recruitment of protein that bind to PI(3)P (more Rab-GEF, tethering factors)

#### How can a compartment mature and change the identity?

<u>Early endosomes possess Rab5 but late endosomes possess Rab7.</u>

How can an early endosome mature into a late endosome?

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324141340580.png" alt="image-20200324141340580" style="zoom:100%;" />
Replacement of a <font color="EE0000">RabA</font> domain by a <font color="EE0000">RabB</font> domain

+ <u>maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes is <font color="EE0000">Rab5</font> to <font color="EE0000">Rab7</font> conversion</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324141409762.png" alt="image-20200324141409762" style="zoom:80%;" />

> Rab Cascades Can Change the Identity of an Organelle
>
> A Rab domain can be disassembled and replaced by a different Rab domain, changing the identity of an organelle
>
> + Such ordered recruitment of sequentially acting Rab proteins is called a **Rab cascade**
> + Over time, for example, **Rab5** domains are replaced by **Rab7** domains on endosomal membranes. This converts an **early endosome,** marked by **Rab5**, into a **late endosome,** marked by **Rab7**.
>  + This process is also referred to as **endosome maturation**. The **self-amplifying nature** of the Rab domains renders the process of endosome maturation unidirectional and irreversible
> + It alters the membrane dynamics, including the incoming and outgoing traffic, and repositions the organelle away from the plasma membrane toward the cell interior

### 3. SNAREs mediate specificity of membrane fusion

Recognition of the fusion target: Interaction between specific v - and t-SNAREs

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324141457426.png" alt="image-20200324141457426" style="zoom:67%;" />

+ v-SNARE: **single** chain on vesicles
+ t-SNARE: **2-3 chains** on target membrane

> The **SNARE proteins** (also called **SNAREs,** for short) catalyze the membrane fusion reactions in vesicle transport.
>
> 1. **v-SNAREs** usually found on vesicle membranes
> + A v-SNARE is a single polypeptide chain, whereas a t-SNARE is usually composed of three proteins
> 2. **t-SNAREs** usually found on target membranes
>
> The resulting **trans-SNARE complex** locks the two membranes together. Biochemical membrane fusion assays with all different SNARE combinations show that t-SNARE pairing is <u>highly specific</u>
>
> The trans-SNARE complexes <u>catalyze</u> membrane fusion <u>by using the energy that is freed when the interacting helices wrap around</u> each other to pull the membrane faces together, simultaneously <u>squeezing</u> out water molecules from the interface
>
> In the cell, other proteins recruited to the fusion site, presumably **Rab effectors**, cooperate with SNAREs to accelerate fusion.
>
> In the process of regulated exocytosis, <u>fusion is delayed</u> until secretion is triggered by a specific extracellular signal

#### SNAREs proteins catalyze membrane fusion

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324141550836.png" alt="image-20200324141550836" style="zoom: 67%;" />

SNARE-mediated bilayer fusion occurs in multiple steps 

+ Pairing between v - and t - SNAREs 
+ Lipid molecules in the two interacting (cytosolic) leaflets flow
+ hemifusion, or half-fusion. 
+ Rupture and “sealing” of the new bilayer completes the fusion reaction.

> **Rab proteins**, which can regulate the availability of SNARE proteins, exert an additional layer of control. t-SNAREs in target membranes are often associated with **inhibitory proteins** that must be released before the t-SNARE can function.
>
> + Rab proteins and their effectors trigger the release of such **SNARE inhibitory proteins.**

### 4. Energy for Membrane Fusion

> Interacting SNAREs Need to Be Pried Apart Before They Can Function Again
>
> A crucial protein called <font color="EE0000">**NSF**</font> cycles between membranes and the cytosol and catalyzes the disassembly process. 
>
> + NSF is a **hexameric ATPase** of the family of **AAA-ATPases**
>
> + The requirement for **NSF-mediated reactivation** of SNAREs by SNARE complex disassembly helps prevent membranes from fusing indiscriminately

Dissociation of SNARE pairs after membrane fusion requires **ATP hydrolysis** by the AAA-ATPase <font color="EE0000">NSF</font>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324141848486.png" alt="image-20200324141848486" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor)
+ SNARE (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptors) protein

### 5. Special Membrane Fusion

Specificity of membrane fusion can be hijacked by viruses : 

Entry of the enveloped HIV virus into cells occurs by specific fusion of the viral membrane with the PM of the cell

+ > Viral fusion proteins and SNAREs promote lipid bilayer fusion in similar ways.

# 二、Transport in ER and Golgi

> Transfer from one compartment to the next involves a **delicate balance** between <u>forward and backward (retrieval)</u> transport pathways.

## Golgi Apparatus

### 1. Localization of the Golgi apparatus 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142329050.png" alt="image-20200324142329050" style="zoom:100%;" />
In animal cells

+ many stacks are linked together to a single complex close to the nucleus and to the centrosome, which is dependent on **microtubule connection**.

In plant cells

+ Golgi stacks, termed dictyosomes（单核小体）, are individually, disperse in the cytoplasm.
+ Cells contain hundreds of individual stacks 

### 2. Structure of Golgi Apparatus

A “Golgi apparatus” is not a simple stack of pancakes!

The “Golgi apparatus” consists of an ordered series of functionally distinct compartments that contain distinct sets of enzymes.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142513812.png" alt="image-20200324142513812" style="zoom:100%;" />
#### Ordered series of Golgi apparatus

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142544073.png" alt="image-20200324142544073" style="zoom:100%;" />
#### Golgins, Golgi matrix proteins, help organize the stack

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142625519.png" alt="image-20200324142625519" style="zoom:50%;" />

A model of golgin function:

+ Filamentous golgins anchored to Golgi membranes capture transport vesicles by binding to <font color="EE0000">Rab</font> proteins on the vesicle surface

### 3. Function of Golgi apparatus

1. Sorting and dispatching station for ER products → **central sorting hub** for proteins

2. Major site of **carbohydrate synthesis** and **secretion of glycoproteins** (lecture 10)

Post-translational attachment of lysosomal sorting signals on soluble proteins for lysosolmal targeting (only mammalian cells) 

The Golgi is both a factory and a bus-station, it <u>produces, modifies and distributes</u>

> It is a major site of **carbohydrate synthesis**, as well as a **sorting** and **dispatching** station for products of the ER. 
>
> + The cell makes many polysaccharides in the Golgi apparatus, including the **pectin**（果胶） and **hemicellulose**（半纤维素） of the cell wall in plants and most of the **glycosaminoglycans**（糖胺聚糖） of the extracellular matrix in animals

## Transport from the ER through the Golgi

> A subset of these oligosaccharide groups serve as tags to direct specific proteins into vesicles that then transport them to **lysosomes**

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142817649.png" alt="image-20200324142817649" style="zoom:80%;" />

### 1. ER export

ER exit requires proper protein folding/assembly

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324142928879.png" alt="image-20200324142928879" style="zoom:100%;" />
Only properly folded and assembled proteins can leave the ER.

Molecular chaperons such as <font color="EE0000">**BiP**</font> (binding protein) and <font color="EE0000">**calnexin**</font> (not shown) facilitate protein folding and intermolecular assembly processes (lecture 10).

Misfolded soluble proteins can’t escape the calnexin cycle (they are bound to this membrane protein) that’s why they cannot exit the ER by bulk-flow!

Misfolded proteins rather will be degraded via the **ERAD pathway** in the cytosol

#### COPII coat

> Proteins Leave the ER in COPII-Coated Transport Vesicles
>
> + These vesicles bud from specialized regions of the ER called **ER exit sites**, whose membrane <u>lacks bound ribosomes</u>
> + These cargo membrane proteins display **exit (transport) signals** on their cytosolic surface that **adaptor proteins** of the inner COPII coat recognize
> + Proteins without exit signals can also enter transport vesicles, including protein molecules that normally function in the ER (so-called **ER resident proteins**), some of which slowly leak out of the ER and are delivered to the Golgi apparatus.
> + Some of these components act as cargo receptors and are <u>recycled back</u> to the ER after they have delivered their cargo to the Golgi apparatus.

ER exit sites: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324143221628.png" alt="image-20200324143221628" style="zoom:100%;" />
Proteins leave the ER in COPII-coated transport vesicles: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324144129686.png" alt="image-20200324144129686" style="zoom:100%;" />
> Some transmembrane proteins that serve as **cargo receptors** for packaging some secretory proteins into COPII-coated vesicles are **lectins** that bind to oligosaccharides on the secreted proteins.
>
> + One such lectin, for example, binds to **mannose** on two secreted **blood-clotting factors** (**Factor V** and **Factor VIII**), thereby packaging the proteins into transport vesicles in the ERs

Transport vesicles can fuse with each other: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324144215623.png" alt="image-20200324144215623" style="zoom:80%;" />

+ The formation of **vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs)** by **homotypic（同型的） fusion** of transport vesicles
 + Homotypic fusion: fusion occurs between vesicles from the <u>same compartment</u>
 + Heterotypic fusion: fusion occurs between vesicles from different compartments.
+ Both are mediated by v-SNARE and t-SNARE interactions, also regulated by <font color="EE0000">Rabs</font>

#### Vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs)

> Vesicular Tubular Clusters Mediate Transport from the ER to the Golgi Apparatus
>
> + The fusion of membranes from the same compartment is called **homotypic fusion**, to distinguish it from **heterotypic fusion**, in which a membrane from one compartment fuses with the membrane of a different compartment.
>
> The structures formed when ER-derived vesicles fuse with one another are called **vesicular tubular clusters,** because they have a convoluted appearance in the electron microscope
>
> + The clusters move quickly along **microtubules** to the Golgi apparatus with which they fuse

Vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) arise from homotypic fusion of COP II vesicles

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324144333293.png" alt="image-20200324144333293" style="zoom: 50%;" />

+ Vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) are forming around an **ER exit site (ERES).** 
+ Many of the vesicle-like structures seen in the micrograph are cross sections of tubules that extend above and below the plane of this thin section and are interconnected. 

**Early endosomes (EE)** originate from homotypic fusion of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles

In mammals, VTCs mediate transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324144635068.png" alt="image-20200324144635068" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ VTCs are short lived and move quickly along the microtubule
+ VTCs can bud off COP I vesicles <u>on their ow</u>n to send back the ER resident protein  - - - a process called **retrieval** ( or retrograde) transport
 + Retrieval requires **ER retrieval signals**, which are recognized by COP I coats directly (on membrane proteins) or indirectly (on soluble proteins via sorting receptors (<font color="EE0000">HDEL/KDEL receptor ERD2</font>)

### 2. Retrograde transport from VTCs or Golgi back to the ER

> COPI-coated vesicles are unique in that the components that make up the inner and outer coat layers are recruited as a preassembled complex, called **coatomer**
>
> + They function as a **retrieval pathway**, <u>carrying back ER resident proteins</u> that have escaped, as well as proteins such as <u>cargo receptors and SNAREs</u> that participated in the ER budding and vesicle fusion reactions.
> + The **retrieval** (or **retrograde**) transport continues as the vesicular tubular clusters move toward the Golgi apparatus.

**Retrograde transport:** carry back the ER resident proteins that “leaked” out

Retrieval of membrane proteins and of soluble ER-resident proteins requires specific sorting signals

> The retrieval pathway for returning escaped proteins back to the ER depends on **ER retrieval signals**
>
> + Resident ER membrane proteins, for example, contain signals that bind directly to COPI coats and are thus packaged into COPI-coated transport vesicles for **retrograde delivery** to the ER

**ER retrieval signals**: <u>di-lysine sequence</u> in “**KKXX**” motif in ER membrane proteins, recognized by COP I coat 

Membrane proteins in Golgi and ER have shorter Transmembrane (TM) domains (15 aa)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324144806955.png" alt="image-20200324144806955" style="zoom:100%;" />
> Soluble ER resident proteins, such as **BiP**, also contain a short ER retrieval signal at their C-terminal end, but it is different: it consists of a **Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu** or a similar sequence
>
> + If this signal (called the <font color="EE0000">**KDEL sequence**</font>) is removed from **BiP** by genetic engineering, the protein is slowly secreted from the cell

<font color="EE0000"><u>H/KDEL</u></font> sequence in soluble ER resident proteins, binds to sorting receptor <font color="EE0000">ERD2 (H/KDEL) receptor</font>

> Unlike the retrieval signals on ER membrane proteins, which can interact directly with the COPI coat, **soluble ER resident proteins** must bind to specialized receptor proteins such as the **KDEL receptor**— a multipass transmembrane protein that binds to the KDEL sequence and packages any protein displaying it into COPI-coated retrograde transport vesicles

**pH controls affinity of KDEL receptors**

### 3. Intra Golgi transport

Intra Golgi transport: cisternal maturation *vs* vesicle transport 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324145048433.png" alt="image-20200324145048433" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Cisternal maturation model: New cisternae are continuously formed at the cis - and lost at the trans - face
+ Vesicle transport model: Cisternae remain, cargo is transported by vesicles from cisternae to cisternae…

#### *In vitro* verification of vesicle-mediated intra-Golgi transport

Cell-free (*in vitro*) transport system to study vesicular transport intra Golgi transport, using Golgi stacks from two different cell populations 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324145258891.png" alt="image-20200324145258891" style="zoom:100%;" />
Experimental strategy:

+ Both Golgi populations are incubated “at cellular conditions” (with cytosol and ATP and “detectable” radiolabeled sugars (3HGlcNAc)) to reconstitute transport

+ Detection of 3HGlcNAc-reporters demonstrates transport

Analysis by tracing of green fluorescent (GF) protein fusions:

+ Proteins were fused with the green fluorescent protein GFP and the red fluorescent protein RFP, respectively, and then visualized by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy

A temperature-sensitive mutant secretory membrane protein:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324145556771.png" alt="image-20200324145556771" style="zoom:67%;" />

Transport is monitored over time after the shift of temperature

Tool:

+ VSVG: Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein
+ ts045 (VSVG–GFP): thermo reversible folding mutant 
+ at 40°C misfolds and is retained in the ER 
+ at 32°C moves as a synchronous population to the Golgi complex before being transported to the plasma membrane

## Summary: ER → Golgi transport

COP (coat protein) II-coated transport vesicle (COP II vesicles) mediate protein transport from the ER to the Golgi

COP II vesicles bud from **ER exit sites (ERES)** at the ribosome-free **transitional ER (tER)** 

Membrane proteins display sorting signals (exit signals) on their cytosolic domain for ER exit

**COP II coat** can recognize the exit signals on membrane proteins directly 

**Soluble secretory proteins** can be exported by “**bulk-flow**” and do not need export signals to leave the ER in COPII vesicles (Need/existence of membrane proteins that act as “export receptors” for soluble proteins has not been unequivocally demonstrated yet) 

**Soluble ER-resident proteins** require the tetrapeptide HDEL as signal for COP I-mediated retrieval for their ER localization

# 三、Transport from Golgi to lysosomes

> **Lysosomes** are membrane-enclosed organelles filled with **soluble hydrolytic enzymes** that digest macromolecules
>
> + All are **acid hydrolases**; that is, hydrolases that work best at acidic pH.
> + A **vacuolar H+ ATPase** in the lysosome membrane uses the energy of **ATP hydrolysis** to <u>pump H+ into the lysosome</u>, thereby maintaining the lumen at its acidic pH
> + The lysosome H+ pump belongs to the family of **V-type ATPases** and has a similar architecture to the mitochondrial and chloroplast ATP synthases (**F-type ATPases**), which convert the energy stored in H+ gradients into ATP

 Lysosomes are heterogeneous:

+ coated pits (CP, 有被小窝; 被膜小窝)
+ early endosome (EE, 早期内体)
+ late endosome (LE, 晚期内体)
+ lysosome (LY, 溶酶体)

## Structure of Lysosomes

Features:

+ Protein rich membranes
 + Lamp/Limp family of glycoproteins


> Most of the lysosome membrane proteins, for example, are <u>highly glycosylated</u>, which helps to <u>protect them from the lysosome proteases in the lumen</u>

+ Unusual lipids
 + lyso-bisphosphatidic acid
 + thought to protect lysosomal membrane lipids from action of lumenal lipases

+ Multivesicular bodies (**MVB**, late endosomes/lysosomes)
 + invagination of the limiting membrane
 + forms internal membranes
 + TM proteins can segregate into limiting or internal membranes
 + limiting membrane can be recycled, internal is not

Lysosomes contain a variety of digestive enzymes that would chew up cell components:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150226966.png" alt="image-20200324150226966" style="zoom:80%;" />

> Lysosomes Are Heterogeneous
>
> + Lysosomes are found in all eukaryotic cells
> + The diversity reflects the wide variety of digestive functions that acid hydrolases mediate, including the breakdown of intra - and extracellular debris, the destruction of phagocytosed microorganisms, and the production of nutrients for the cell
>
> Their morphological diversity, however, also reflects the way lysosomes form
>
> + **Late endosomes** containing material received from both the plasma membrane by endocytosis and newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases fuse with preexisting lysosomes to form structures that are sometimes referred to as **endolysosomes**, which then fuse with one another.
> + When the majority of the endocytosed material within an endolysosome has been digested so that only resistant or slowly digestible residues remain, these organelles become **“classical” lysosomes**

> Plant and Fungal Vacuoles Are Remarkably Versatile Lysosomes
>
> Most plant and fungal cells (including yeasts) contain one or several very large, fluid-filled vesicles called **vacuoles**
>
> + Vacuoles are <u>related to animal cell lysosomes</u> and <u>contain a variety of **hydrolytic enzymes**,</u> but their functions are remarkably diverse
> + The plant vacuole can act as a **storage organelle** for both <u>nutrients and waste products</u>, as a degradative compartment, as an economical way of increasing cell size, and as a controller of **turgor pressure** (the **osmotic pressure** that pushes outward on the cell wall and keeps the plant from wilting (枯萎；衰弱))
> + The same cell may have different vacuoles with distinct functions, such as digestion and storage
> + The vacuole is important as a **homeostatic device**, enabling plant cells to withstand wide variations in their environment
> + They do so by changing the osmotic pressure of the cytosol and vacuole—in part by the <u>controlled breakdown and re-synthesis of polymers</u> such as polyphosphate in the vacuole, and in part by <u>altering the transport rates of sugars,</u> amino acids, and other metabolites across the plasma membrane and the vacuolar membrane

## Protein sorting to lysosome

### 1. Mannose-6-phosphate

> A Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptor Sorts Lysosomal Hydrolases in the Trans Golgi Network
>
> + In animal cells they carry a unique marker in the form of **mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) groups**, which are added exclusively to the **N-linked oligosaccharides** of these soluble lysosomal enzymes <u>as they pass through the lumen of the **cis Golgi network**</u>
> + Transmembrane **M6P receptor proteins**, which are <u>present in the TGN</u>, recognize the M6P groups and bind to the lysosomal hydrolases on the <u>lumenal side</u> of the membrane and to adaptor proteins in assembling **clathrin coats** on the cytosolic side.

Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P): post-translational glycan modification:

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150318841.png" alt="image-20200324150318841" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ The synthesis of the lysosomal sorting signal on a soluble hydrolase

#### Mannose-6-phosphate targets proteins to lysosomes

> M6P group cause the lysosomal hydrolases to dissociate from these receptors, making the transport of the hydrolases <u>unidirectional.</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150428370.png" alt="image-20200324150428370" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Lysosomal sorting signals on soluble lysosomal proteins emerge in the TGN

### 2. Sorting Process

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150458248.png" alt="image-20200324150458248" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Lysosomal sorting signal: mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)

+ Lysosomal sorting receptor: mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150605506.png" alt="image-20200324150605506" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ M6P receptor protein binds best at pH 6.5-6.7 in the TGN lumen, and release at pH 6.0 (early endosome), which is the pH in the lumen of endosomes

> Thus, after the receptor is delivered, the lysosomal hydrolases dissociate from the M6P receptors, which are retrieved into transport vesicles that bud from endosomes
>
> These vesicles are coated with <font color="EE0000">**retromer**</font>, a coat protein complex <u>specialized for endosome-to-TGN transport,</u> which returns the receptors to the TGN for reuse

+ M6P is then hydrolyzed inside endosome

> Transport in either direction requires **signals in the cytoplasmic tail** of the M6P receptor that direct this protein to the endosome or back to the TGN
>
> These signals are <u>recognized by the retromer complex</u> that recruits M6P receptors into transport vesicles that bud from endosomes
>
> + The recycling of the M6P receptor resembles the recycling of the **KDEL receptor** discussed earlier, although it differs in the type of coated vesicles that mediate the transport

> Not all the hydrolase molecules that are tagged with M6P get to lysosomes. Some <u>escape</u> the normal packaging process in the trans Golgi network and are transported “by default” to the cell surface, where they are secreted into the <u>extracellular fluid</u>
>
> As lysosomal hydrolases require an acidic milieu to work, the can do little harm in the <u>extracellular fluid</u>, which usually has a neutral pH of 7.4.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704125625029.png" alt="image-20200704125625029" style="zoom:100%;" />
> pH influenced sorting example:
>
> + The <u>low pH</u> in the endosome induces <font color="EE0000">transferrin</font> to <u>release</u> its bound iron, but the iron-free transferrin itself (called **apotransferrin**) remains bound to its receptor.
> + The **receptor–apotransferrin complex** enters the tubular extensions of the early endosome and from there is recycled back to the plasma membrane. When the **apotransferrin** returns to the <u>neutral pH</u> of the extracellular fluid, it <u>dissociates</u> from the receptor and is thereby freed to pick up more iron and begin the cycle again
> + Thus, transferrin <u>shuttles back</u> and forth between the extracellular fluid and early endosomes, avoiding lysosomes and <u>delivering iron to the cell interior,</u> as needed for cells to grow and proliferate

> Since all glycoproteins leave the ER with identical N-linked oligosaccharide chains, the signal for adding the M6P units to oligosaccharides <u>must reside somewhere in the polypeptide chain of each hydrolase</u>
>
> Genetic engineering experiments have revealed that the recognition signal is a cluster of neighboring amino acids on each protein’s surface, known as a **signal patch**
>
> Since most lysosomal hydrolases contain <u>multiple oligosaccharides</u>, they acquire <u>many M6P groups</u>, providing a high-affinity signal for the M6P receptor.

### 3. Diseases

Rare diseases associated with failure in TGN-lysosome transport: **Lysosome storage diseases (LSD)**: 

+ **I-cell disease** (I-细胞疾病): defect in **GlcNAc-phosphotransferase**, resulting in failure of lysosomal hydrolases to be transported to lysosome, instead, they are secreted out of the cell.

+ **Hurler’s disease** (赫尔勒氏症): defect in a certain enzyme important for breakdown of glycosaminoglycan chains

+ **Albinism** (白化病): defect in exocytosis of pigment lysosomes such as melanocytes

#### Inclusion (I)-cell disease

GlcNAC-phosphotransferase <u>phosphorylates mannose on lysosomal proteins</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324150844937.png" alt="image-20200324150844937" style="zoom:100%;" />
## Trafficking to lysosome

### 1. Multiple Pathways Deliver Materials to Lysosomes

Three pathways lead to degradation in the lysosome: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704123224223.png" alt="image-20200704123224223" style="zoom:100%;" />
> 1. The best studied of these degradation paths is the one followed by <u>macromolecules taken up from extracellular fluid</u> by **endocytosis**. 
> 2. A similar pathway found in phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils in vertebrates, is dedicated to the engulfment, or **phagocytosis**, of large particles and microorganisms to form **phagosomes**
> 3. A third pathway called **macropinocytosis** specializes in the <u>nonspecific uptake</u> of <u>fluids, membrane, and particles attached to the plasma membrane</u>. 
> 4. A fourth pathway called **autophagy originates in the cytoplasm** of the cell itself and is used to <u>digest cytosol and worn-out organelles</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704123245725.png" alt="image-20200704123245725" style="zoom:100%;" />
### 2. Autophagy

#### Introduction

> All cell types dispose of obsolete parts by a lysosome-dependent process called **autophagy**, or “self-eating.”
>
> + It helps restructure differentiating cells, but also in adaptive responses to stresses such as **starvation** and **infection**. Autophagy can remove large objects—**macromolecules**, large **protein aggregates**, and even **whole organelles**—that other disposal mechanisms such as **proteasomal degradation** cannot handle
> + In the initial stages of autophagy, cytoplasmic cargo becomes surrounded by a double membrane that assembles by the fusion of small vesicles of unknown origin, forming an **autophagosome**
>
> The whole process occurs in the following sequence of steps:
>
> 1. Induction by <u>activation of signaling molecules</u>: Protein kinases (including the <font color="EE0000">**mTOR complex 1**</font>, discussed in Chapter 15) that <u>relay information about the metabolic status of the cell</u>, become **activated** and <u>signal to the autophagic machinery.</u>
> 2. Nucleation and extension of a <u>delimiting</u> membrane into a crescent-shaped cup: Membrane vesicles, characterized by the presence of <font color="EE0000">**ATG9**</font>, the only transmembrane protein involved in the process, are recruited to an **assembly site**, where they <u>nucleate autophagosome formation</u>. 
> + **ATG9** is <u>not incorporated into the autophagosome</u>: a **retrieval pathway** must remove it from the assembling structure.
> 3. **Closure** of the membrane cup around the target to form a **sealed double-membrane-enclosed autophagosome**.
> 4. **Fusion** of the autophagosome with lysosomes, catalyzed by <font color="EE0000">**SNAREs**</font>.
> 5. **Digestion** of the inner membrane and the lumenal contents of the **autophagosome**.

#### Selective / Nonselective

> Autophagy can be either nonselective or selective
>
> In **nonselective autophagy**, a bulk portion of cytoplasm is sequestered in autophagosomes. It might occur, for example, in **starvation conditions**
>
> In **selective autophagy** specific cargo is packaged into autophagosomes that tend to contain little cytosol, and their shape reflects the shape of the cargo. Selective autophagy mediates the degradation of worn out, or otherwise unwanted, mitochondria, peroxisomes, ribosomes, and ER; it can also be used to destroy invading microbes
>
> + The selective autophagy of worn out or damaged **mitochondria** is called **mitophagy**
> + Damaged mitochondria <u>cannot maintain the gradient</u>, so <u>protein import is blocked</u>. As a consequence, a protein kinase called <font color="EE0000">**Pink1**</font>, which is normally imported into mitochondria, is instead retained on the mitochondrial surface where it recruits the ubiquitin ligase <font color="EE0000">**Parkin**</font> from the cytosol
>  + Mutations in **Pink1** or **Parkin** cause a form of early-onset **Parkinson’s disease,**

# 四、Endocytosis

Two major types of endocytosis:

1. Phagocytosis (large particles 250 nm in diameter)
2. Pinocytosis (**∼** 100 nm in diameter), Pinocytosis ingests small amount of fluid and plasma membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151220090.png" alt="image-20200324151220090" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ A macrophage is “eating” two red blood cells
+ Macrophages can eat 1011 old red blood cells/day

## Factors triggering endocytosis

“Eat-me” signal: Factors triggering endocytosis:

1. Antibody coated pathogens.
2. Complements in pathogens.
3. Oligosaccharides in microorganisms
4. Phosphotidylserine (PS) in apoptotic cells

## Phagocytosis engulfs large particles and microorganisms

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151616255.png" alt="image-20200324151616255" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Pseudopod extension and phagosome formation are driven by **actin polymerization and reorganization**, which respond to the accumulation of specific phosphoinositides in the membrane of the forming phagosome:
 + <font color="EE0000">PI(4,5)P~2~ </font> stimulates actin polymerization (promotes pseudopod formation)
 + <font color="EE0000">PI(3,4,5)P~3~ </font>stimulates depolymerizes actin filaments at the base. 

> In endocytosis, the material to be ingested is progressively enclosed by a small portion of the plasma membrane, which first **invaginates** and then pinches off to form an **endocytic vesicle** containing the ingested substance or particle
>
> + Most eukaryotic cells <u>constantly form endocytic vesicles</u>, a process called **pinocytosis** (“cell drinking”); in addition
> + some specialized cells contain dedicated pathways that <u>take up large particles on demand</u>, a process called **phagocytosis** (“cell eating”).

> Specialized Phagocytic Cells Can Ingest Large Particles
>
> **Phagocytosis** is a special form of endocytosis in which a cell uses large endocytic vesicles called **phagosomes** to ingest large particles such as microorganisms and dead cells. Phagocytosis is <u>distinct, both in purpose and mechanism</u>, from **macropinocytosis**
>
> Phagocytosis is important in most animals for purposes other than nutrition, and it is carried out mainly by specialized cells—so-called **professional phagocytes**.
>
> + In mammals, two important classes of white blood cells that act as professional phagocytes are **macrophages** and **neutrophils**
> + These cells develop from hemopoietic stem cells and they ingest invading microorganisms to defend us against infection.
> + **Macrophages** also have an important role in scavenging senescent (变老的) cells and cells that have died by apoptosiss

### 1. Pinocytosis

#### Caveolae-mediated pinocytosis

This is Clathrin-independent endocytosis

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151712417.png" alt="image-20200324151712417" style="zoom: 67%;" />

> Pinocytic Vesicles Form from Coated Pits in the Plasma Membrane
>
> **Pinocytosis** varies between cell types, but it is usually surprisingly high
>
> + Since a cell's surface area and volume remain unchanged during this process, it is clear that the same amount of membrane being removed by endocytosis is being added to the cell surface by the converse process of **exocytosis**
>
> The endocytic part of the cycle often begins at **clathrin-coated pits**. These specialized regions typically occupy about 2% of the total plasma membrane area
>
> + The lifetime of a clathrin-coated pit is short: within a minute or so of being formed, it invaginates into the cell and pinches off to form a **clathrin-coated vesicle**
>
> Not All Pinocytic Vesicles Are Clathrin-Coated
>
> In addition to clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, cells can form other types of pinocytic vesicles, such as **caveolae** (from the Latin for “little cavities”), originally recognized by their ability to transport molecules <u>across endothelial cells</u> that form the inner lining of blood vessels
>
> + **Caveolae**, sometimes seen in the electron microscope as deeply invaginated flasks, are <u>present in the plasma membrane of most vertebrate cell types</u>
>
> + They are thought to form from **lipid rafts** in the plasma membrane, which are rich in in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins
>
> > The major structural proteins in caveolae are **caveolins**, a family of unusual integral membrane proteins that each insert a hydrophobic loop into the membrane from the cytosolic side but <u>do not extend across the membrane</u>
> >
> > On their cytosolic side, caveolins are bound to large protein complexes of caving proteins, which are thought to stabilize the membrane curvature.
>
> + In contrast to clathrin-coated and COPI or COPII-coated vesicles, caveolae are usually static structures and they can be induced to pinch off and serve as endocytic vesicles to transport cargo to early endosomes or to the plasma membrane on the opposite side of a polarized cell (**Transcytosis**).
>
> + Some animal viruses such as **SV40** and **papillomavirus** (which causes warts) enter cells in vesicles derived from caveolae
>
> + **Cholera** toxin (discussed in Chapters 15 and 19) also enters the cell through caveolae and is transported to the ER before entering the cytosol

#### Clathrin-mediated pinocytosis

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151808035.png" alt="image-20200324151808035" style="zoom:100%;" />
Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME)

+ 25 different receptors mediate this type of endocytosis
+ Many different receptors cluster in the same pit
+ The similar receptors can cluster in different pits 

### 2. Macropinocytosis

Clathrin-independent endocytosis

> Macropinocytosis is another clathrin-independent endocytic mechanism that can be activated in <u>practically all animal cells</u>
>
> In most cell types, it does not operate continually but rather is induced for a limited time in response to cell-surface receptor activation by specific cargoes, including **growth factors**, **integrin ligands**, **apoptotic cell remnants**, and some viruses
>
> + These ligands <u>activate a complex signaling pathway</u>, resulting in a change in <u>actin dynamics</u> and the formation of cell-surface protrusions, called **ruffles**（皱纹、褶皱）
> + When **ruffles** collapse back onto the cell, large fluid-filled endocytic vesicles form, called **macropinosomes**
>
> Macropinocytosis is a <u>dedicated **degradative pathway**</u>: macropinosomes acidify and then fuse with late endosomes or endolysosomes, <u>without recycling their cargo back</u> to the plasma membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151744545.png" alt="image-20200324151744545" style="zoom:67%;" />



### 3. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis

#### A low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle

Cholesterol uptake by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on the cell surface

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324151855501.png" alt="image-20200324151855501" style="zoom:50%;" />

Structure of the LDL

+ Atherosclerosis: leads to stroke and heart attack. It occurs by Failure to take up LDL into cells, which causes accumulation of LDL in the blood, which then forms Atherosclerotic plaques.

#### Receptor-mediated endocytosis: cholesterol uptake

Cholesterol uptake by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on the cell surface

> Most cholesterol is transported in the blood as cholesteryl esters in the form of lipid–protein particles known as **low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)**
>
> Once in the plasma membrane, the **LDL receptors** diffuse until they associate with **clathrin-coated pits** that are in the process of forming
>
> + There, an endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of the LDL receptors binds the membrane-bound adaptor protein <font color="EE0000">**AP2**</font> after its conformation has been locally unlocked by binding to <font color="EE0000">**PI(4,5)P~2~ **</font>on the plasma membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152028702.png" alt="image-20200324152028702" style="zoom:100%;" />
> Specific Proteins Are Retrieved from Early Endosomes and Returned to the Plasma Membrane
>
> **Early endosomes** are the <u>main sorting station</u> in the endocytic pathway, just as the cis and trans Golgi networks serve this function in the secretory pathway.
>
> + In the mildly acidic environment of the early endosome, many <u>internalized receptor proteins change their conformation</u> and release their ligand, as already discussed for the M6P receptors.

#### Endocytosis of LDL by normal and mutant LDL receptors 

> If too much free cholesterol accumulates in a cell, the cell shuts off both its own cholesterol synthesis and the synthesis of LDL receptors, so that it ceases both to make or to take up cholesterol.

#### pH dependent interactions

affects protein-protein interactions in endolytic compartments

## Lysosomes and endosomes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152315746.png" alt="image-20200324152315746" style="zoom:80%;" />

> 1. Once generated at the plasma membrane, most endocytic vesicles fuse with a common receiving compartment, the **early endosome**, where <u>internalized cargo is sorted:</u> some
> 1. cargo molecules are **returned to the plasma membrane**
> 2. directly or via a **recycling endosome**
> 3. others are designated for degradation by inclusion in a **late endosome**
> 2. **Late endosomes** form from a bulbous, vacuolar portion of early endosomes by a process called **endosome maturation.**
> + This conversion process changes the protein composition of the endosome membrane, patches of which invaginate and become incorporated within the organelles as **intralumenal vesicles**, while the <u>endosome itself moves from the cell periphery to a location close to the nucleus</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704144326106.png" alt="image-20200704144326106" style="zoom:100%;" />
### 1. Lysosomes maturation

Late endosome-lysosome pathway mediated by multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/late endosomes (LEs): endosome maturation

**Multivesicular body (MVB)**: Intralumenal vesicles formed via membrane invagination become incorporated within the lysosome. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152530343.png" alt="image-20200324152530343" style="zoom:100%;" />

> Each of the stages of endosome maturation—from the early endosome to the endolysosome—is connected through <u>bidirectional vesicle transport pathways</u> to the **TGN**

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704144326106.png" alt="image-20200704144326106" style="zoom:100%;" />
#### Early Endosomes Mature into Late Endosomes

> 1. The distribution of the molecule after its uptake reveals the sequence of events. Within a minute or so after adding the tracer, it starts to appear in **early endosomes**, just beneath the plasma membrane
> 2. By 5–15 minutes later, it has moved to **late endosomes**, close to the **Golgi apparatus** and near the nucleus.
>
> Early endosomes have tubular and vacuolar domains. Most of the membrane surface is in the **tubules** and most of the volume is in the vacuolar domain
>
> + During endosome maturation, the two domains have different fates: 
> 1. the **vacuolar portions** of the early endosome are retained and transformed into late endosomes; 
> 2. the **tubular portions** shrink
>
> **Maturing endosomes**, also called **multivesicular bodies**, migrate along microtubules toward the cell interior, shedding membrane tubules and vesicles that recycle material to the plasma membrane and TGN, and receiving newly synthesized lysosomal proteins
>
> As they concentrate in a perinuclear region of the cell, the multivesicular bodies fuse with each other, and eventually with endolysosomes and lysosomes

> Many changes occur during the maturation process
>
> 1. The endosome **changes shape and location**, as the tubular domains are lost and the vacuolar domains are thoroughly modified
> 2. **Rab proteins**, **phosphoinositide lipids**, **fusion machinery** (SNAREs and tethers), and **microtubule motor proteins** all participate in a molecular **makeover**（打扮、装饰） of the cytosolic face of the endosome membrane, changing the functional characteristics of the organelle
> 3. A **V-type ATPase** in the endosome membrane pumps H+ from the cytosol into the endosome lumen and **acidifies** the organelle.
> 4. **Intralumenal vesicles** **sequester**（扣押） endocytosed signaling receptors inside the endosome, thus halting the receptor signaling activity.
> 5. Lysosome proteins are **delivered** <u>from the TGN to the maturing endosome.</u>
>
> Most of these events occur gradually but eventually lead to a complete transformation of the endosome into an early endolysosome.
>
> In addition to committing selected cargo for degradation, the maturation process is important for lysosome maintenances

### 2. The fate of endocytosed receptor proteins

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152629620.png" alt="image-20200324152629620" style="zoom:100%;" />
1. **Recycling directly back** to the same PM domain via an recycling endosome
2. **Transcytosis** “recycling” to a different PM domain
3. **Degradation** via <font color="EE0000">ESCRT pathway</font>

#### Recycling of the LDL-receptors

> Plasma Membrane Signaling Receptors are Down-Regulated by Degradation in Lysosomes
>
> A second pathway that endocytosed receptors can follow from endosomes is taken by many signaling receptors, including **opioid receptors** and the receptor that binds **epidermal growth factor (EGF)**
>
> + Unlike LDL receptors, EGF receptors accumulate in **clathrin-coated pits** only after binding their ligand, and most do not recycle but are <u>degraded in lysosomes</u>, along with the ingested EGF
> + This is a a process called **receptor downregulation**, that reduces the cell's subsequent sensitivity to EGF

> Receptor downregulation is highly regulated. The activated receptors are first covalently modified on the cytosolic face with the small protein **ubiquitin**
>
> + Unlike **polyubiquitylation**, which adds a chain of ubiquitins that typically targets a protein for degradation in proteasomes, ubiquitin tagging for sorting into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway adds just <u>one or a few</u> single ubiquitin molecules to the protein—a process called **monoubiquitylation** or **multiubiquitylation**, respectively.
> + **Ubiquitin-binding proteins** recognize the attached ubiquitin and <u>help direct</u> the modified receptors into **clathrin-coated pits**
> + After delivery to the **early endosome**, other ubiquitin-binding proteins that are part of <font color="EE0000">**ESCRT** **complexes** (ESCRT = Endosome Sorting Complex Required for Transport)</font> recognize and sort the ubiquitylated receptors into intralumenal vesicles, which are retained in the maturing late endosome
>
> In this way, <u>addition of ubiquitin **blocks receptor recycling** to the plasma membrane</u> and **<u>directs the receptors into the degradation pathways</u>**

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152743640.png" alt="image-20200324152743640" style="zoom:80%;" />

+ Other receptors don’t recycle but are degraded in lysosomes instead (e.g. EGFR opioid receptors).
 + This process is called receptor down-regulation. 

**Retromer**-mediates receptor recycling back to Golgi :

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152831524.png" alt="image-20200324152831524" style="zoom: 67%;" />

+ Working model of Retromer

**Transferrin receptor** (转铁蛋白受体) and **opioid receptor** are sorted differently：

> The **transferrin receptor** follows a similar recycling pathway as the LDL receptor, but unlike the LDL receptor it also recycles its ligand

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324152930154.png" alt="image-20200324152930154" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### (1) Transcytosis in polarized epithelial cells 

> Receptors on the surface of polarized epithelial cells can transfer specific macromolecules from one extracellular space to another by **transcytosis**
>
> The transcytotic pathway from the early endosome back to the plasma membrane is not direct
>
> + The receptors first move from the **early endosome** to the **recycling endosome**
> + many receptors also **possess sorting signals** that guide them into the appropriate transport pathway
>
> recycling endosomes play an important part in adjusting the concentration of specific plasma membrane proteins

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153146657.png" alt="image-20200324153146657" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Different pH in two sides of cells decides association and dissociation between receptor and its ligand

+ Different sorting signals in receptors may play a role in transcytosis 

##### (2) Storage of plasma membrane proteins in recycling endosomes

Recycling endosomes can serve as an **intracellular storage site** for specialized plasma membrane proteins that can be mobilized when needed

+ Example: regulated transport of glucose transporters to the PM: 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153240462.png" alt="image-20200324153240462" style="zoom:100%;" />
##### (3) Selective down-regulation of PM proteins through endocytosis

Cells can actively regulate receptor mediated endocytosis for downregulation/degradation of receptors (signal termination): 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153340792.png" alt="image-20200324153340792" style="zoom:80%;" />

1. Mono - and multi-ubiquitination of receptors
2. Ubiquitin binding（泛素结合） proteins recognizes these receptors
3. Direct clathrin coat assembly

##### (4) Ubiquitination tags

Ubiquitination tags serves as recognition marks for formation of multivesicular body 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153504112.png" alt="image-20200324153504112" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### ESCRT proteins

> ESCRT Protein Complexes Mediate the Formation of Intralumenal Vesicles in Multivesicular Bodies
>
> + As endosomes mature, patches of their membrane invaginate into the endosome lumen and pinch off to form **intralumenal vesicles**
> + Because of their appearance in the electron microscope such maturing endosomes are also called **multivesicular bodies**

ESCRT proteins recognize both ubiquitination and PIPs signals during multivesicular body formation

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153542599.png" alt="image-20200324153542599" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
+ Mutations in ESCRT proteins are associated with prolonged signaling and cancer 

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis takes up specific proteins from plasma membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153617360.png" alt="image-20200324153617360" style="zoom:100%;" />
1. Clathrin-coated vesicles fuse with endosomes where low pH dissociates receptors from cargos.
2. Receptors returned to plasma membrane and Cargos delivered to lysosome.
3. Multivesicular bodies process receptors for degradation in lysosomes.

# 五、Secretion and exocytosis

(From TGN to plasma membrane)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153724614.png" alt="image-20200324153724614" style="zoom:100%;" />
+ Formation of secretory particle 
+ Signaling to release secretory content
+ Membrane lipid and protein after exocytosis

## The formation of the secretory vesicles

> Many Proteins and Lipids Are Carried Automatically from the Trans Golgi Network (TGN) to the Cell Surface
>
> + A cell capable of regulated secretion must separate at least three classes of proteins before they leave the TGN:
>
> 1. those destined for **lysosomes** (via endosomes)
>
>  Proteins destined for lysosomes are tagged with **M6P** for packaging into specific departing vesicles, and analogous signals are thought to direct secretory proteins into **secretory vesicles**
>
> 2. those destined for **secretory vesicles**
>
> 3. those destined for immediate delivery to the **cell surface**
>
> + The nonselective constitutive secretory pathway transports most other proteins directly to the cell surface. Because entry into this pathway does not require a particular signal, it is also called the **default pathway**
>
> Secretory Vesicles Bud from the Trans Golgi Networks

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200704180843550.png" alt="image-20200704180843550" style="zoom:100%;" />
Concentration of cargo is achieved by:

+ Aggregation of cargo in the TGN
+ Removal of membranes by retrograde transporting CCVs

## Exocytosis of secretory vesicles

> Cells that are specialized for secreting some of their products rapidly on demand concentrate and store these products in **secretory vesicles** (often called **densecore secretory granules** because they have dense cores when viewed in the electron microscope)
>
> + Secretory vesicles form from the TGN, and they release their contents to the cell exterior by exocytosis in response to specific signals.
>
> The secreted product can be either a small molecule (such as **histamine** or a **neuropeptide**) or a protein (such as a **hormone** or **digestive enzyme**).

> At least three signal in TGN should be clearly recognized:
>
> 1. Signal-mediated diversion to **lysosomes** (via endosomes)
> 2. signal-mediated diversion to **secretory vesicles** (for regulated secretion)
> 3. **constitutive secretory pathway**
>
> It is unclear how the aggregates of secretory proteins are segregated into secretory vesicles

> Initially, most of the membrane of the secretory vesicles that leave the TGN is only <u>loosely wrapped</u> around the clusters of aggregated secretory proteins.
>
> Morphologically, these i**mmature secretory vesicles** resemble **dilated** trans Golgi cisternae that have pinched off from the Golgi stack. As the vesicles mature, they <u>fuse with one another</u> and their contents become <u>concentrated</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324153936356.png" alt="image-20200324153936356" style="zoom:100%;" />
## Precursors of secretory proteins

> **Proteolysis** is necessary to liberate the active molecules from these precursor proteins. The cleavages occur <u>in the secretory vesicles</u> and sometimes <u>in the extracellular fluid after secretions</u>
>
> Additionally, many of the precursor proteins have an N-terminal **pro-peptide** that is cleaved off to yield the mature protein. These proteins are synthesized as **pre-pro-proteins**, the pre-peptide consisting of the ER signal peptide that is cleaved off earlier in the rough ER
>
> The <u>same polyprotein</u> may be processed in various ways to produce <u>different</u> peptides in different cell types

Pre-pro-peptide

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324154002503.png" alt="image-20200324154002503" style="zoom:100%;" />
> Why is proteolytic processing so common in the secretory pathway?
>
> 1. Some protein, such as enkephalins (five-amino-acid neuropeptides with morphine-like activity), are <u>undoubtedly too short in their mature forms</u> to be co-translationally transported into the ER lumen or to include the necessary signal for packaging into secretory vesicles
> 2. In addition, for secreted hydrolytic enzymes—or any other protein whose activity could <u>be harmful inside the cell that makes it</u>, delaying activation of the protein until it reaches a secretory vesicle, or until after it has been secreted
> + the delay prevents the protein from acting prematurely inside the cell in which it is synthesized.

## Constitutive secretion *vs* regulated secretion

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324154031408.png" alt="image-20200324154031408" style="zoom:67%;" />

### 1. Constitutive secretion

<u>Exists in all eukaryotic cells</u>

Cargo molecules of this transport are: 

+ membrane proteins
+ lipid molecules
+ proteins from the extra cellular matrix (ECM)

### 2. Regulated secretion

<u>Exists mainly in specialized secretory cells</u>

Cargo molecules of this transport are: 

+ hormones, histamine, etc.
+ Neurotransmitters
+ digestive enzymes

#### How to trigger secretory vesicle to release its content?

Example 1: in nerve cells, voltage-gated Ca^2+^ channel influx Ca^2+^, which triggers nerve cells to release neurotransmitters. (lecture 8) 

Example 2: ligand binding stimulate mast cells to release histamine 

##### (1) Ca^2+^ influx trigger neurotransmitter release

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324154240910.png" alt="image-20200324154240910" style="zoom:100%;" />
#### Formation of synaptic vesicles

> Nerve cells (and some endocrine cells) contain two types of secretory vesicles.
>
> 1. As for all secretory cells, these cells package proteins and neuropeptides in **dense-cored secretory** vesicles in the standard way for release by the regulated secretory pathway
> 2. In addition, however, they use another specialized class of tiny (≈50 nm diameter) secretory vesicles called **synaptic vesicles**.
> + These vesicles store small **neurotransmitter molecules**, such as acetylcholine, glutamate, glycine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which mediate rapid signaling from nerve cell to its target cell at chemical synapses
> 
> + When an action potential arrives at a nerve terminal, it causes an **influx of Ca^2+^** through **voltage-gated Ca^2+^ channels**, which triggers the synaptic vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents to the extracellular space
> 
> + The speed of transmitter release (taking only <u>milliseconds</u>) indicates that the proteins mediating the fusion reaction do not undergo complex, multistep rearrangements
> 
> + After vesicles have been docked at the presynaptic plasma membrane, they undergo a **priming step**, which <u>prepares them for rapid fusion</u>. In the primed state, the **SNAREs** are <u>partly paired</u>, their helices are not fully wound into the final four-helix bundle required for fusion
> 
>  > Proteins called <font color="EE0000">**complexins**</font> freeze the SNARE complexes in this metastable state
>  >
>  > The brake imposed by the **complexins** is released by another synaptic vesicle protein,<font color="EE0000"> **synaptotagmin**</font>, which contains Ca^2+^-binding domains.
>  >
>  > A rise in cytosolic Ca^2+^ <u>triggers</u> binding of **synaptotagmin** to phospholipids and to the SNAREs, <u>displacing the **complexins**</u>

> Synaptic Vesicles Can Form Directly from Endocytic Vesicles

#### Secretion can be locally restricted or can occur all over in the cell 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324154311927.png" alt="image-20200324154311927" style="zoom:100%;" />
## membrane lipids and proteins

What happens to the membrane lipids and proteins after exocytosis? 

1. Transiently fused with plasma membrane: forward flow 
2. then recycled or to lysosomes for degradation-- - retrograde flow

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200324154555635.png" alt="image-20200324154555635" style="zoom:100%;" />

### 1. sorting plasma membrane proteins

Two ways of sorting plasma membrane proteins in a polarized epithelial cell

> Proteins from the ER destined for different domains travel together until they reach the TGN, where they are separated and dispatched in secretory or transport vesicles to the appropriate plasma membrane domain

> The **apical plasma** membrane of most epithelial cells is greatly enriched in **glycosphingolipids**, which help protect this exposed surface from damage
