# 一、How to study animal Physiology



1. How does this happen? 【The underlying mechanism】
2. Why does this happen? 【What is the meaning of this phenomenon or behabiour?  -  The Evaluation scale】
 + Natural selection is a key process of Evolutionary Origin  -  by which animals become fit to live in their environment
  1. **Natural selection** – increase in frequencies of genes that produce phenotypes favoring survival.
  2. **Adaptation significance**, also called an **adaptive trait** (适应特征), is a trait with a current functional role in the life history of an organism that is maintained and evolved by means of natural selection. 
  + Adaptation refers to both the **current state** of being adapted and to the **dynamic evolutionary process** that leads to the adaptation. 
  + Adaptations <u>enhance the fitness and survival of individuals</u>. (i.e.: firefly emits lights to attract mates to enhance reproduction）

# 二、Animals and the Environment

Conformity vs Regulation:

1. Conformity: 依照, 遵从; 符合, 一致, 从众
 + Example: Salmon body temperature changes with the environment. 
 + CONFORMITY: body changes with outside condition; avoids the cost of energy.
2. Regulation: 管理；规则；校准
 + Salmon are excellent chloride regulators 
 + REGULATION: costs energy; permits cells to function in a steady condition

Homeostasis:

> Homeostasis or homoeostasis is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant.

## Earth’s major physical and Chemical Environments

the big THREE set the stage for life:

1. Temperature
2. Oxygen
3. Water

Changes in physiology that are responses to changes in the external environment

| Type of change            | Description             |
|  - ---------------------------------------------------------- - |  - ---------------------------------------------------------- - |
| **Acute changes**【Phenotypic responses of Individual animals】 | Short-term changes in the physiology of individual animals: changes that individuals exhibit soon after their environments have changed. Acute changes are reversible. |
| **Chronic changes** (termed <u>acclimation</u> and <u>acclimatization</u> also termed phenotypic plasticity or phenotypic flexibility)【Phenotypic responses of Individual animals】 | Long-term changes in the physiology of individual animals changes that individuals display after they have been in new environments for days, weeks, or months. <u>Chronic changes are reversible</u> |
| **Evolutionary changes**【Phenotypic changes of populations】 | Changes that occur by alteration of gene frequencies over the course of multiple generations in populations exposed to new environments |

+ Acclimation (适应, a laboratory phenomenon） vs. Acclimatization (驯化）

 > **Acclimation**： Acclimation is defined as physiological or behavioral changes that occur within the lifetime of an organism and which reduce or enhance tolerance of the strain caused by experimentally induced stressful changes—specifically, climatic factors
 >
 > **Acclimatization** or **acclimatisation** (also called acclimation or acclimatation) is the process in which an individual organism adjusts to a change in its environment (such as a change in altitude, temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH), allowing it to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions. Acclimatization occurs in a short period of time (hours to weeks), and within the organism's lifetime (compared to adaptation, which is a development that takes place over many generations).

 1. **Evolution**: is a change of gene frequencies over time in a population of organisms. (explain Hg gene allele changes)
 2. **Adaptation**: is a trait that is present in <u>high frequency in a population</u> and confers a greater probability of survival and successful of reproduction in the prevailing environment than available alternative traits.
  + Natural selection leads to adaptation 
  + Some processes of evolution are adaptive, others are not
  + Adaptation – confers a greater probability of survival and successful reproduction in the prevailing environment than available alternative traits. (not an optimum or ideal state)
  + Non-adaptive evolution (genetic drift-by chance; mice 10 km apart have many allele frequencies differences produced by drifts)
  + **Genetic drift** (遗传漂变，基因漂变): processes in which chance assumes a preeminent role in altering gene frequencies
   + There are two types of genetic drift, the bottleneck effect and the founder effect.
   + A **population bottleneck** (or genetic bottleneck) is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events (such as earthquakes, floods, fires, disease, or droughts) or human activities (such as genocide).
   + In population genetics, the **founder effect** is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population.

+ **Phenotypic plasticity**: the ability of an individual animal (a single genotype) to express two or more genetically controlled phenotypes.

Changes in physiology that are internally programmed to occur whether or not the external environment changes

| Type of Change         | Description             |
|  - ---------------------------------------------- - |  - ---------------------------------------------------------- - |
| Developmental changes       | Changes in the physiology of individual animals that occur in programmed way as the animals mature from conception to adulthood and then to senescence(see Chapter 4) |
| Changes controlled by periodic biological clocks | Changes in the physiology of individual animals that occur in repeating patterns(e.g. each day)und trol of the animals internal biological clocks(see Chapter 15) |

## Physiological Function Regulation Methods

1. Nervous regulation  -  reflex
2. Humoral regulation  -  hormone
3. Auto-regulation – blood flow to brain and kidney are not affected within certain range by blood pressure (myogenic mechanism)

### 1. Regulation System

1. Non-automatic control system (open-system)
2. Feedback control system (closed-system)
3. Feed-forward control system (is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion)

# 三、TAKE HOME MESSAGES

1. How Animal Physiology is Studied?

2. The definition of Animal Physiology

3. Two central questions Physiology seeks to answer –mechanism and origin (why and how)

4. Definition for Evolution

5. Homeostasis – conformity VS regulation

6. Phenotypic changes of an individual animal vs a population (adaption, genetic drift)

## Group Discussion

#### Question 1

Animals do not keep all their detoxification enzymes in a constant state of readiness. Thus they depend on phenotypic plasticity to adapt to changing hazards. An example is provided by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which breaks down ethyl alcohol. People who do not drink alcoholic beverages have little alcohol dehydrogenase. Expression of the enzyme increases when people drink alcohol, but full expression requires many days, meaning that people are incompletely defended against alcohol’s effects when they first start drinking after a period of not drinking.

Consider, also, that muscles atrophy when not used, rather than being maintained always in a fully developed state.

Propose reasons why animals depend on phenotypic plasticity, instead of maintaining all their systems in a maximum state of readiness at all times.

#### Answer 1

Answer 2: Maintaining proteins costs energy; thus, unused capacities are not cost-free. Protein molecules occupy space in cells, and dissolved proteins add to the total solute concentrations of intracellular fluids. In terms of hypotheses we can offer to explain the phenomena described, failure to maintain proteins at all times may be a means of (i) avoiding unnecessary energy costs or (ii) keeping cell contents or concentrations below acceptable maxima

#### Question 2

Certain species of animals tolerate body temperatures of 50°C, but the vast majority do not. Some species can go through their life cycles at very high altitudes, but most cannot. What are the potential reasons that certain exceptional species have evolved to live in environments that are so physically or chemically extreme as to be lethal for most animals? How could you test some of the ideas you propose?

#### Answer 2

Answer 10: If a species can evolve to live where most organisms cannot, it may avoid predation or disease, because predators or pathogens cannot live there. Another hypothesis is that if a species can evolve to live where most organisms cannot live, it may be able to get most of the food there

To test this last idea, if a herbivore species (食植动物）lives over a range of habitats that are non-extreme and extreme, you could carry out measurements to see if the percentage of vegetable matter it eats is greater in the extreme parts of its range that in the non-extreme parts where competitors are better able to live
