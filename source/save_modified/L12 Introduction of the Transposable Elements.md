### Transposition: An Overview

**Transposition** involves the integration of small segments of DNA into the chromosome

+ This can occur at many different locations within the genome

These small, mobile DNA segments are termed **transposable elements (TEs)**

+ Sometimes referred to as "jumping genes"

TEs were first identified by Barbara McClintock in the early 1950s from her classical studies in corn

+ Since then, many different types of TEs have been found in species as diverse as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals

### Transposition Pathways

Many transposable elements have been found in bacteria, fungi, plant and animal cells

Three general types of transposition pathways have been identified

1. Simple or conservative transposition (cut-and-paste transposition)

2.	Replicative transposition
3.	Retrotransposition

# 一、Simple Transposition

This mechanism is also called "cut-and-paste”

It is widely found in bacteria and eukaryotes

## Insertion Sequence

**Inverted repeats (IR)** are DNA sequences that are identical (or very similar) but run in opposite directions, such as

## Composite Transposon

Contain additional genes that are not necessary for transposition per se

Only the two inverted repeats at the end of the transposon are involved in the transposition event

## Transposase

The enzyme **transposase** catalyzes the <u>removal</u> of a TE and the its <u>reinsertion</u> at another location

Transposase recognizes the inverted repeats at the ends of a TE and brings them close together

<u>形成了新的directed repeat</u>

## Increase Copy Number

# 二、Replicative Transposition

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191210184240199.png" alt="image-20191210184240199" style="zoom: 50%;" />

This mechanism involves reolicntion of the TE and insertion of the codv into another chromosomal location

It is relatively uncommon and only found in bacteria

## Replicative Transposition: Requires Both Transposase and Resolvase

Replicative transposition has been studied in several bacterial transposons and in phage

The net result of replicative transposition is that a TE occurs at a new site and the TE remains in its original location

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191210184418321.png" alt="image-20191210184418321" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191210185131717.png" alt="image-20191210185131717" style="zoom: 45%;" />

Transposase makes cuts at the arrows and the strands are exchanged and ligated together.

The gaps are filled in by DNA polymerase and sealed by DNA ligase to produce a cointegrant.

Resolvase catalyzes recombination between the 2 elements. This resolves the cointegrant into 2 separate structures, each with a copy of the transposable element.

# 三、Retrotransposition (RNA Transposon)

Transcription → Retrotranscription → Integration

This mechanism is very common but <u>only found in eukaryotes</u>

TE moves via an RNA intermediate.

These types of elements are termed **retroelements**, **retrotransposons**, or **retroposons**

The organization of retroelements can be quite variable

They are categorized based on their evolutionary relationship to retroviral sequences

+ Retroviruses are RNA viruses that make a DNA copy that integrates into the host's genome

## LTR Retrotranspson

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191211193140126.png" alt="image-20191211193140126" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Long terminal repeats (LTR)** are typically a few hundred nucleotides long

Evolutionarily related to known retroviruses

Like their viral counterparts, they encode virally related proteins that are needed for the transposition process

## Non-LTR Retrotranspson

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191211193428382.png" alt="image-20191211193428382" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Appear less like retroviruses

+ May contain a gene encoding a protein with both reverse transcriptase and endonuclease function
+ Some are evolutionarily derived from normal eukaryotic genes

## Retroelements Use Reverse Transcriptase and Integrase

Retroelements use an RNA intermediate in their transposition mechanism

The movement of retroelements also requires two key

enzymes:

+ Reverse transcriptase
+ Integrase

# 四、Influences of Transposons

## Transposable Elements Influences on Mutation and Evolution

Over the past few decades, researchers have found that transposable elements probably occur in the genomes of all species
