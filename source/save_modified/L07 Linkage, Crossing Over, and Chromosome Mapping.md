# Linkage

**Genetic Linkage** is the phenomenon that genes close together on a chromosome tend to be transmitted as a unit, which influences inheritance patterns

Chromosomes are called **linkage groups**. They contain a group of genes that are linked together

<u>The number of linkage groups is the number of types of chromosomes of the species</u>

对人来说，女性有23个linkage group（22+X），男性有24个linkage group（22+XY）

+ 22 autosomal linkage groups 
+ An X chromosome linkage group 
+ A Y chromosome linkage group

For linkage group, crossing-over should be in consideration

# Crossing Over

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191031163325232.png" alt="image-20191031163325232" style="zoom:50%;" />

The term **linked or linkage** means that two or more genes do not independently assort and tend to be <u>transmitted together</u>

Genes that are <u>far apart</u> on the same chromosome may independently assort from each other <u>because of the crossing-over</u>

+ A **dihybrid cross** studies linkage between two genes
+ A **trihybrid cross** studies linkage between three genes

## Multiple Crossovers

## Meiosis Prophase I: Diplonema 双线期

The synaptonemal complex degrades and paired chromosomes separate slightly but are in contact as **chiasmata（染色体交叉）**

## Direct Evidence That Crossing Over Results In Recombination

Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock worked with corn 

In previous cytological examinations of corn, they found a chromosome number 9 that had two abnormalities (异常情况)

# Chromosome Mapping

Genetic mapping is also known as **gene mapping** or **chromosome mapping**

Its purpose is to <u>determine the linear order of linked genes along the same chromosome</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191117162320663.png" alt="image-20191117162320663" style="zoom:100%;" />
Genetic maps are useful in many ways including 

+ Aiding in diagnosis of human disease 

+ Aiding in cloning of disease genes 

+ Predict likelihood of offspring having traits

Genetic maps can be made by 

+ **Recombination analysis** **→** **Genetic map** 
+ Molecular approaches including sequencing

## recombination analysis

Genetic map created by recombination analysis <u>estimates the relative distances between linked genes.</u>

The percentage of recombinant offspring is correlated with the distance between the two genes:

1. If the genes are far apart, would be many recombinant offspring.
2. If the genes are close, would be very few recombinant offspring

Measure the **recombination frequency** by testcross(测交):

Recombination frequency represent the intensity of linkage between genes

• Recombination frequency <u>never exceeds 50% (for 2 genes)</u>
$$
\ \ \ \ \ \ Heterozygote\ for\ two\ or\ more\ genes\ 
\\X\\
\ Homozygote\ recessive\ for\ the\ same\ genes
$$

## Construction of Genetic Map

By calculating recombination frequencies between each pair of adjacent genes, we are able to construct a map of a large segment of the chromosome

### Interference

This lower-than-expected value is due to a common genetic phenomenon, termed interference

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191031170729610.png" alt="image-20191031170729610" style="zoom:50%;" />

The extent of the interference is measured by the coefficient of coincidence.

The interference(I) is expressed as:
$$
I = 1-C
$$
C is the coefficient of coincidence:
$$
C = \frac{Observed\ number\ of\ double\ crossovers}{Expected\ nuber\ of\ double\ crossovers}
$$
The $I$ means $(I \cdot 100\%)$ of the expected number of crossovers did not occur

The **genetic map distance** may be <u>much greater</u> than the **observed recombination frequency**

Multiple crossovers occur between widely separated genes, but some of these crossover do not produce genetically recombinant chromosomes.

## Recombination Frequency Vs. Genetic Map Distance

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191031171709849.png" alt="image-20191031171709849" style="zoom: 50%;" />

用重组频率来表示基因之间的相对距离具有一定的局限性

Example: Recombination near the centromere (in heterochromatin)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191110100529745.png" alt="image-20191110100529745" />

Very little recombination takes place in heterochromatin; a small distance in the genetic map corresponds to a large distance on the chromosome.

+ Map distances based on recombination frequencies are <u>not a direct measurement</u> of physical distance along a chromosome
+ <u>Recombination "hot spots"</u> overestimate physical length
+ <u>Low rates in heterochromatin and centromeres</u> underestimate (估计不足) actual physical length
