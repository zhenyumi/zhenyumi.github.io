# 一、Introduction to Microbial Taxonomy

**Taxonomy** 

+ consists of three separate but interrelated parts

1. **classification** – arrangement of organisms into groups (taxa; s., taxon) 

2. **nomenclature** – assignment of names to taxa 

3. **identification** – determination of taxon to which an isolate belongs

## Natural Classification 自然分类法

First classification in 18th century developed by Linnaeus 

+ based on <u>anatomical（结构(上)的; 解剖的）</u> characteristics 

This approach to classification does not necessarily provide information on evolutionary relatedness

## Polyphasic Taxonomy 多相分类法

Incorporates information from genetic, phenotypic, and phylogenetic analysis

Highest rank is domain 

+ *Bacteria* and *Archaea* – microbes only 

+ *Eukarya* – microbes and macroorganisms

Within domain 

phylum, class, order, family, genus, species , epithet, some microbes have subspecies

1. Domain 界
2. Phylum 门
3. Class 纲
4. Order 目
5. Family 科
6. Genus 属
7. Species 种

### 1. Species

#### Definition

collection of strains that share many stable properties and differ significantly from other groups of strains 

Another definition also suggested as a definition of species is:

+ collection of organisms that share the same sequences in their core housekeeping genes

Example: *Escherichia coli*

### 2. Strains 系

Descended from a single, pure microbial culture

Vary from each other in many ways

+ biovars（生物变型；生化变种） – differ biochemically and physiologically 

+ morphovars（形态变型 ） – differ morphologically 

+ serovars（血清变型） – differ in <u>antigenic properties</u> 

Example：*Escherichia coli* K12 

### 3. Type Strain 模式株，模式菌株

Usually one of first strains of a species studied 

Often most fully characterized 

Not necessarily most representative member of species 

Example： *Escherichia coli* O1:K1:H7 U5/41

## Binomial System of Nomenclature

Devised by Carolus Linnaeus

Each organism has two names：

+ genus name – italicized and capitalized (e.g., *Escherichia*) 

+ species epithet（ (表示性质、特征等的)词语） – italicized but not capitalized (e.g., *coli*)

Can be abbreviated after first use (e.g., *E. coli)*

A new species cannot be recognized until it has been published in the <u>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</u>

# 二、Techniques for Determining Microbial Taxonomy and Phylogeny 

## Classical characteristics

1. morphological 

2. physiological 

3. biochemical 

4. ecological 

5. genetic 

### 1. morphological

### 2. Ecological Characteristics

1. Life-cycle patterns 

2. Symbiotic relationships 

3. Ability to cause disease 

4. Habitat preferences 

5. Growth requirements

### 3. Molecular Characteristics

1. Nucleic acid base composition 

2. Nucleic acid hybridization 

3. Nucleic acid sequencing 

4. Genomic fingerprinting 

5. Amino acid sequencing

#### Nucleic Acid Base Composition

G + C content

Mol% G + C = (G + C) / (G + C + A + T) x 100

usually determined from melting temperature ($T_{m}$)

variation within a genus usually <10%

#### Nucleic Acid Hybridization 

DNA-DNA hybridization 

+ measure of sequence homology

#### Nucleic Acid Sequencing

Small subunit rRNAs (SSU rRNAs) 

+ 16S and 18S rRNA 

+ inferring microbial phylogenies and making taxonomic assignments at **genus** level 

+ **70%** is cutoff value for **species** definition

#### Genomic Fingerprinting 基因组指纹

Requires analysis of genes that evolve more quickly than rRNA encoding genes 

##### (1) multilocus sequence analysis (**MLSA**,多位点序列分析 ) 

+ the sequencing and comparison of 5 to 7 housekeeping genes is done to prevent misleading results from analysis of one gene 

##### (2) Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)

Uses restriction enzymes to recognize specific nucleotide sequences

+ cleavage patterns are compared 

**Ribotyping** 

 similarity between rRNA genes is determined by RFLP rather than sequencing

##### (3) Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)

Looks at single nucleotide changes, or polymorphisms, in specific genes 

Regions targeted because they are normally conserved, so single changes in a base pair reveal evolutionary change
