# law of thermodynamics

## 1. The first law of thermodynamics

Energy is conserved

### Enthalpy（H）

To descript the total energy of a thermodynamic system.
$$
H = U+pV
$$
For a biochemical reaction (under constant pressure of 1 bar), ΔH = the amount of heat produced in system between the initial and final states

## 2. The second law of thermodynamics

Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered from doing so

### Equilibrium

​	Reversible processes，正向与反向的反应速度相等

### Far from equilibrium

​	Irreversible processes (spontaneous processes)

### Entropy（S）

Entropy measures the s**pontaneous dispersal of energy**: how much energy is spread out in a process, or how widely spread out it becomes — at a specific temperature

The degree of randomness

The entropy of an isolated system will tend to increase to a maximum value

### Gibbs Free Energy（G）

In closed system，entropy is dominant，but biological systems are open system
$$
G = H-TS  \\ \Delta G = \Delta H-T\Delta S
$$

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G °+RT lnQ
$$

R = the gas constant = 8.314 J/mol$\cdot$k
Q = reaction quotient = [productes]/[reactants]

在平衡时，$\Delta G = 0,\ \Delta G° = -RTlnQ$

#### The favored process in thermodynamics
+ In the direction Gibbs Free Energy minimum
+ $\Delta$ G is negative (A description of second law in open systems)


## 3. Cell Drive unfavorable reactions

使得 Q < K，从而使得unfavorable reactions 得以进行

通过**Coupling an unfavorable reaction to a highly favorable reaction** 实现

## Biological organisms develop from disorder
1. Entropy in an open system can decrease
2. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics

## Philosophy of life
+ Life is an irreversible process
+ Equilibrium with environment = DEATH
+ Living organisms costs dying of the universe (Entropic)


# The applications of free energy in biological systems

## 1. Biological dynamics

1. ATP hydrolysis
1. Protein dynamics (protein folding)
1. Ligand binding
1. Membrane diffusion
1. Enzyme kinetics

## 2. Cell metabolism

1. Photosynthesis
1. Cell respiration

# Enzyme kinetics

<font color="990000">The kinetics determine the reaction rate, and the dynamics determine weather the reaction will happen</font>

favorable reactions可能反应速率并不快，Lower energy barrier, and thereby increase reaction rate. 而降低energy barrier 就是酶的工作。
