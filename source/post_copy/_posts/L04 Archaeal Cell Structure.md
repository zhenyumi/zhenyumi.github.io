# 一、A Typical Archaeal Cell

## Introduction to Archaea

Archaea live in extreme conditions:

1. anaerobic swamps
2. salt lakes
3. acidic hot springs
4. deep sea hydrothermal vents
5. animal digestive systems

Archaeal taxonomy is currently in a state of flux, but two phyla are well established:
**Crenarchaeota（泉古菌门）** and **Euryarchaeota（广古菌门）**.

+ Many features in common with Eukarya
  + genes encoding protein: replication, transcription, translation

+ Features in common with Bacteria
  + genes for metabolism

+ Other elements are unique to Archaea
  + unique rRNA gene structure
  + capable of methanogenesis

## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

Much like bacteria, cocci and rods are common shapes. Other shapes can also exist

+ branched/flat shapes
+ no spirochetes or mycelial forms yet

Sizes vary (typically 1-2 x 1-5 μm for rods, 1-5 μm in diameter for cocci)

Smallest observed is 0.2 pm in diameter

Largest is a multicellular form that can reach 30 mm in length!

## Cell Organization

The ar­chaeal plasma membrane is composed of strikingly <u>different lip­ids</u> than those found in bacterial membranes; in fact, the unusual lipids were one of the first pieces of evidence to suggest that these microbes are phylogenetically distinct from bacteria

Most ar­ chaea have a cell wall, but their walls are considerably <u>more di­verse than bacterial walls.</u> And archaeal cell walls <u>lack peptidoglycan.</u>

# 二、Archaeal Cell Envelopes

## Cell Envelop

Differ from bacterial envelopes in the molecular makeup and organization

+ S layer may be only component outside plasma membrane

+ some lack cell wall

+ capsules and slime layers are rare

+ pseudomurein (peptidoglycan-like polymer)

+ only Ignicoccus（燃球菌属） has outer membrane

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1568875449081.png" alt="1568875449081" style="zoom:50%;" />

Some archaea have <u>mono­layer membranes that function like bilayers</u>. This structural differ­ence is due to the presence of unique lipids in archaeal plasma membranes.

Archaeal cell envelopes also differ in terms of organi­zation. For many archaea, <u>an S-layer is the major, and sometimes only, component of the cell wall</u>. Finally, <u>capsules and slime lay­ers are relatively rare</u> among archaea and thus are not discussed.

S layer may be only component outside plasma membrane

1. some lack cell wall
1. capsules and slime layers are rare
1. pseudomurein (伪胞壁质，peptidoglycan-like polymer)
1. only Ignicoccus has outer membrane

### 1. Pseudomurein

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1568875543601.png" alt="1568875543601" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Archaeal Plasma Membranes and Nutrient Uptake

### 1. Membranes

Some have a monolayer structure instead of a bilayer structure

Composed of unique lipids

+ isoprene units (five carbon, branched)
+ ether linkages rather than ester linkages to glycerol

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191220224519288.png" alt="image-20191220224519288" style="zoom: 33%;" />

Archaeal membranes are composed primarily of lipids that differ from bacterial and eukaryotic lipids in two ways:

1. First, they contain hydrocarbons derived from <u>isoprene</u> units-five-carbon, branched molecules (figure 4.3). Thus the hydrocarbons are branched as shown in figure 4.4. This affects the way the lipids pack together, which in turn <u>affects the fluidity of the membrane and its permeability.</u>

Some have a monolayer structure instead of a bilayer structure
•Composed of **unique lipids**

1. **isoprene（橡胶基质） units** (five carbon, branched)
1. **ether linkages（醚键）** rather than **ester linkages（酯键）** to glycerol

### 2. Nutrient Uptake

Archaeal cells use many of the same mechanisms for nutrient uptake exhibited in bacteria

1. facilitated diffusion
1. active transport (primary and secondary)
   •<u>No group translocation mechanisms have yet been discovered in archaea,</u>

# 三、Archaeal cytoplasm

古菌与细菌的细胞质结构非常相似：

1. lack of membrane-enclosed organelles
1. May contain inclusion bodies (e.g. gas vesicles for buoyancy control)
1. All the usual components
   + ribosomes
   + nucleoid region
   + inclusion bodies

## Ribosomes

古菌的核糖体具有细菌的特征，同时也具有一些真核细胞的特点：

Entire ribosome

+ bacterial/archaeal ribosome = 70S

Bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA 

+ 16S small subunit
+ 23S and 5S in large subunit
+ <u>but archaea have additional **5.8S** (also seen in eukaryotic large subunit)</u>

Proteins vary（古菌与细菌的蛋白质不尽相同）：

<u>archaea more similar to eukarya than to bacteria</u>

## The Nucleoid 拟核

1. Usually <u>not membrane bound</u> (few exceptions)
1. Usually 1 (some evidence for polyploidy in some archaeons)
1. Supercoiling and nucleoid proteins (**histones**, **Alba（脑白质）**, condensins) aid in folding

# 四、Archaeal external structures

## Pili

1. not well understood as of yet
1. some composed of pilin protein
1. have a central lumen similar to bacterial flagella, but not bacterial pili
1. may be involved in archaeal adhesion mechanisms

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1568876963063.png" alt="1568876963063" style="zoom:67%;" />

## Flagella

**Flagella thinner than bacteria’s** 

1. More than one type of flagellin protein
1. Flagellum are not hollow
1. Hook and basal body difficult to distinguish
1. Growth occurs at the base, not the end

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1568877032386.png" alt="1568877032386" style="zoom:40%;" />

## Cannulae（插管、套管）

+ hollow, tubelike structures on the surface of thermophilic archae in the genus *Pyrodictium*（热网菌属）

+ function is unknown

+ may be involved in formation of networks of multiple daughter cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191220225459383.png" alt="image-20191220225459383" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Hami

+ not well understood

1. ‘grappling hook’ appearance
1. involvement in cell adhesion mechanisms?
