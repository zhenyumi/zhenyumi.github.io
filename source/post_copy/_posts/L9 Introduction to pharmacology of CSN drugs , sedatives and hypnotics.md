## Ion Channels

### 1. Voltage-gated ion channels

**Sodium (Na^+^) channels**: have similar functional properties across many different cell types. While ten human genes encoding for sodium channels have been identified, their function is typically conserved between species and different cell types. (**initiators**)

**Calcium (Ca^2+^) channels**: With sixteen different identified genes for human calcium channels, this type of channel differs in function between cell types. Ca^2+^ channels give rise to action potentials similarly to Na^+^ channels in some neurons. They also play a role in neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic nerve endings. (**final executors**) 

**Potassium (K^+^) channels**: the largest and most diverse class of voltage-gated channels, with over 100 encoding human genes. some inactivating extremely slowly and others inactivating extremely quickly. This difference in activation time influences the duration and rate of action potential firing, which has a significant effect on electrical conduction along an axon as well as synaptic transmission. (**modulators**)

**Chloride (Cl^−^) channels**: are present in every type of neuron. With the chief responsibility of controlling excitability, chloride channels contribute to the maintenance of cell resting membrane potential and help to regulate cell volume.

**Proton (H^+^) channels**: carry currents mediated by hydrogen ions in the form of hydronium, and are activated by depolarization in a pH-dependent manner. They function to remove acid from cells.

## Metabotropic receptors

1. This class of receptors includes the metabotropic glutamate receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, GABA~B~ receptors, and most serotonin receptors, as well as receptors for norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, dopamine, neuropeptides and endocannabinoids. 
2. Metabotropic receptors have neurotransmitters as ligands, which, when bound to the receptors, initiate <u>cascades</u> that can lead to channel-opening or other cellular effects. 
3. **G protein-coupled receptors** are inherently metabotropic. Other examples of metabotropic receptors include **tyrosine kinases** and **guanylyl cyclase receptors**.

**Action Potential**: the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory

### 1. The synapse & synaptic potentials

#### EPSP: excitatory postsynaptic potential

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407111542540.png" alt="image-20210407111542540" style="zoom:100%;" />

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407111546644.png" alt="image-20210407111546644" style="zoom:100%;" />

When an excitatory pathway is stimulated, a small depolarization or excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is recorded. This potential is due to the excitatory transmitter acting on an ionotropic receptor, causing an increase in cation permeability. Changing the stimulus intensity to the pathway, and therefore the number of presynaptic fibers activated, results in a graded change in the size of the depolarization. When a sufficient number of excitatory fibers are activated, the excitatory postsynaptic potential depolarizes the postsynaptic cell to threshold, and an all-or-none action potential is generated.

#### IPSP: inhibitory postsynaptic potential

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407111727908.png" alt="image-20210407111727908" style="zoom:100%;" />

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407111736652.png" alt="image-20210407111736652" style="zoom:100%;" />

When an inhibitory pathway is stimulated, the postsynaptic membrane is hyperpolarized owing to the selective opening of Cl– channels, producing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) 

However, because the equilibrium potential for Cl– is only slightly more negative than the resting potential (~ –65 mV), the hyperpolarization is small and contributes only modestly to the inhibitory action. The opening of the Cl– channel during the inhibitory postsynaptic potential makes the neuron "leaky" so that changes in membrane potential are more difficult to achieve. As a result, an excitatory postsynaptic potential that evoked an action potential under resting conditions fails to evoke an action potential during the inhibitory postsynaptic potential

+ E: Excitatory neuron, blue Neurotransmitters: Glutamate
+ I: Inhibitory neuron, gray Neurotransmitters: Glycine; GABA

Hierarchical systems include all the pathways directly involved in sensory perception and motor control. The pathways are generally clearly delineated, being composed of large myelinated fibers that can often conduct action potentials at a rate of more than 50 m/s.

## Central neurotransmitters

### 1. Amino acids: Glutamate - Excitatory Neurotransmitter

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407113958035.png" alt="image-20210407113958035" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Glutamine is imported into the glutamatergic neuron (A) and converted into glutamate by glutaminase. The glutamate is then concentrated in vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter. 

Upon release into the synapse, glutamate can interact with AMPA and NMDA ionotropic receptor channels (AMPAR, NMDAR) in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and with metabotropic receptors (MGluR) on the postsynaptic cell (B). Synaptic transmission is terminated by active transport of the glutamate into a neighboring glial cell (C) by a glutamate transporter. It is synthesized into glutamine by glutamine synthetase and exported into the glutamatergic axon. 

(D) shows a model NMDA receptor channel complex consisting of a tetrameric protein that becomes permeable to Na^+^ and  Ca^2+^ when it binds a glutamate molecule.

<img src="https://hexo20200628-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Articles/Academic_Notes/Molecular%20Pharmacology/image-20210407114026393.png" alt="image-20210407114026393" style="zoom:100%;" />

Unlike AMPA and kainate receptors, all NMDA receptors are highly permeable to  Ca^2+^ as well as to Na^+^ and K^+^. 

Another key difference between AMPA and kainate receptors on the one hand, and NMDA receptors on the other, is that AMPA and kainate receptor activation results in channel opening at resting membrane potential, whereas NMDA receptor activation does not. This is due to the voltage-dependent block of the NMDA pore by extracellular Mg2+. When the neuron is strongly depolarized, as occurs with intense activation of the synapse or by activation of neighboring synapses, Mg2+ is expelled and the channel opens. 

+ Thus, <u>there are two requirements for NMDA receptor channel opening: Glutamate must bind the receptor and the membrane must be depolarized</u>. 
+ The rise in intracellular  Ca^2+^ that accompanies channel opening results in a long-lasting enhancement in synaptic strength that is referred to as **long-term potentiation (LTP)**. The change can last for many hours or even days and is generally accepted as an important cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory.
