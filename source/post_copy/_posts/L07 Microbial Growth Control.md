# 一、Principles of microbial control

![image-20191118191405519](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118191405519.png)

## Definition of Frequently Used Terms

### 1. Sterilization 杀菌

destruction or removal of all viable organisms

### 2. Disinfection 消毒

killing, inhibition, or removal of disease causing (pathogenic) organisms (not bacterial endospore) 

disinfectants 

+ usually chemical 

+ usually used on inanimate (无生命的) objects

### 3. Sanitization 清洁

reduction of microbial population to levels deemed safe (based on public health standards)

### 4. Antisepsis 抗菌

prevention of infection of living tissue by microorganisms

antiseptics

+  chemical agents that kill or inhibit growth of microorganisms when applied to tissue

### 5. Comparisons of The Four Method

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118191903231.png" alt="image-20191118191903231" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Antimicrobial Agents

### 1. Chemotherapy

use of chemicals to kill or inhibit growth of microorganisms within host tissue 

Agents that kill microorganisms or inhibit their growth 

+ **cidal agents**（杀菌剂） kill (bacteri<u>cide</u>s) 

+ **static agents（抗菌剂）** inhibit growth (bacterio<u>static</u>) 

## The Pattern of Microbial Death

Microorganisms are not killed instantly 

Population death usually occurs exponentially （指数的,幂数的）

Measure of agent’s killing efficiency：  **decimal reduction time （D Value）** – time to kill 90%

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118192331801.png" alt="image-20191118192331801" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Conditions Influencing the Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Agent Activity

1. Population <u>size</u> 
   + larger populations take longer to kill than smaller populations 

2. Population <u>composition</u> 
   + microorganisms differ markedly in their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents

3. Concentration or intensity of an antimicrobial agent 
   + usually higher concentrations kill more rapidly 

4. Duration of exposure 

   + longer exposure → more organisms killed

5. Temperature 
   + higher temperatures usually increase killing

6. Local environment
   + pH, viscosity, concentration of organic matter, etc.  can profoundly impact effectiveness  
   + organisms in biofilms are less susceptible to many antimicrobial agents 

# 二、Mechanical removal methods

## Filtering Liquids

Membrane filters 

+ porous（能渗透的；有气孔的；多孔渗水的） membranes with defined pore sizes

![image-20191118192754539](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118192754539.png)

## Filtering Air

# 三、Physical Control Methods

## Heat

### 1. Moist Heat 湿热

Destroys viruses, fungi, and bacteria 

Boiling will <u>not destroy spores and does not sterilize</u> 

Degrades nucleic acids, denatures proteins, and disrupts membranes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118193050124.png" alt="image-20191118193050124" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### 2. Steam Sterilization 蒸汽灭菌

Carried out above 100°C which requires saturated steam under pressure  

Uses an **autoclave** （高压蒸气灭菌器）

Effective against all types of microorganisms <u>(**including** **endospores!**)</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118193212567.png" alt="image-20191118193212567" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 3. Pasteurization 加热杀菌(法);巴斯德氏杀菌法

Controlled heating at temperatures well below boiling

Process does not sterilize but does <u>kill pathogens present and slow spoilage by reducing the total load of organisms present</u> 

![image-20191118193304213](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118193304213.png)

### 4. Dry Heat Sterilization 干热灭菌

<u>Less effective than moist heat sterilization</u>, requiring higher temperatures and longer exposure times

+ items subjected to 160–170°C for 2 to 3 hours

Oxidizes cell constituents and denatures proteins 

### 5. Dry Heat Incineration 干热焚烧 

Bench top incinerators are used to sterilize inoculating loops used in microbiology laboratories

![image-20191118193457240](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191118193457240.png)

## Radiation

### 1. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation

+ mutations — death

+ causes formation of thymine dimers in DNA

+ requires direct exposure on microbial surface

<u>Wavelength of 260</u> is most bactericidal (DNA absorbs) 

Causes thymine dimers preventing replication and transcription 

UV <u>limited to surface sterilization</u> because it does not penetrate glass, dirt films, water, and other substances

### 2. Ionizing Radiation 电离辐射

+ x-rays and gamma rays

+ mutations — death (sterilization)

+ disrupts chemical structure of many molecules, including DNA and proteins

<u>Gamma radiation</u> penetrates deep into objects 

<u>Destroys bacterial endospores</u> 

Used for sterilization and pasteurization of antibiotics, hormones, plastic disposable supplies, and food

### 3. Visible Light

at high intensities generates singlet oxygen($^{1}O_{2}$)

+ powerful oxidizing agent 

  

  carotenoid （类胡萝卜素） pigments

+ protect many light-exposed microorganisms from photooxidation (光氧化（作用）)

# 四、Chemical Agents

## Aldehydes 醛类

### 3. Cell-to-Cell Communication – Quorum Sensing (群体感应)

#### Introduction

Bacterial cells in biofilms communicate in a density-dependent manner called **quorum** **sensing** 

Produce small proteins that increase in concentration as microbes replicate and convert a microbe to a competent state

+ DNA uptake occurs, bacteriocins are released

**Acylhomoserine** **lactone (AHL)** is an autoinducer molecule produced by many gram-negative organisms

+ diffuses across plasma membrane

+ once inside the cell, induces expression of target genes regulating a variety of functions

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231154506235.png" alt="image-20191231154506235" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Quorum Sensing Systems

Processes regulated by quorum sensing involve host-microbe interactions

+ symbiosis – *Vibrio fischeri* and bioluminescence in squid

+ pathogenicity and increased virulence factor production

+ DNA uptake for antibiotic resistance genes

# 六、Laboratory culture of cellular microbes 

## Types of Culture Media

| Basis for Classification | Types                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### 2. Classidied by Functions

#### Supportive or General Purpose Media

**Supportive or general purpose media** (e.g. TSA)

+ support the growth of many microorganisms

#### Enriched Media

**Enriched media** (e.g. blood agar)

+ general purpose media supplemented by blood or other special nutrients

#### Selective Media

favor the growth of some microorganisms and inhibit growth of others

• e.g., MacConkey agar

+ selects for gram-negative bacteria

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231160551820.png" alt="image-20191231160551820" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### Differential Media

Distinguish between different groups of microorganisms based on their biological characteristics

e.g., blood agar

+ hemolytic versus nonhemolytic bacteria

• e.g., MacConkey agar

+ lactose fermenters versus nonfermenters

![image-20191231160651194](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231160651194.png)

![image-20191231160705254](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231160705254.png)

## Isolation of Pure Cultures

Population of cells arising from a single cell developed by Robert Koch

Streak plate, spread plate, and pour plate are techniques used to isolate pure cultures

### 1. Streak Plate

Spreading a mixture of cells on an agar surface so that individual cells are well separated from each other

+ involves use of bacteriological loop

Each cell can reproduce to form a separate colony

![image-20191231161632713](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231161632713.png)

### 2. Spread Plate

small volume of diluted mixture containing approximately 30–300 cells is transferred

spread evenly over surface with a sterile bent rod

![image-20191231161704393](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231161704393.png)

### 3. Pour Plate

sample is serially diluted 

diluted samples are mixed with liquid agar

mixture of cells and agar are poured into sterile culture dishes

Both spread and pour plate may be used to determine the number of viable microorganisms in an original sample

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231161805216.png" alt="image-20191231161805216" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Microbial Growth on Solid Surfaces

Colony characteristics that develop when microorganisms are grown on agar surfaces aid in identification

Differences in growth rate from edges to center is due to 

+ oxygen, nutrients, and toxic products

+ cells may be dead in some areas

![image-20191231162041359](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162041359.png)

## The Growth Curve

Growth refers to population growth rather than growth of individual cells

Usually plotted as logarithm of cell number versus time and has four/five distinct phases

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162111009.png" alt="image-20191231162111009" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### 1. Lag Phase

Cell synthesizing new components

+ e.g., to replenish spent materials

+ e.g., to adapt to new medium or other conditions

Varies in length

+ in some cases can be very short or even absent

### 2. Exponential (Log) Phase

Also called **log phase**

Rate of growth and division is constant and maximal (**balanced growth**) 

Population is most uniform in terms of chemical and physical properties during this phase

### 3. Unbalanced Growth

Rates of synthesis vary relative to each other

Occurs under a variety of conditions

+ change in environmental conditions

+ change in nutrient levels

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162351634.png" alt="image-20191231162351634" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 4. Stationary Phase

Closed system population growth eventually ceases, total number of viable cells remains constant 

+ active cells stop reproducing or reproductive rate is balanced by death rate

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162441815.png" alt="image-20191231162441815" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### Possible Reasons For Stationary Phase

Nutrient limitation

Limited oxygen availability

Toxic waste accumulation

Critical population density reached

### 5. Prolonged Decline in Growth 增长持续下降

Process marked by successive waves (连续波) of genetically distinct variants

+ Bacterial population continually evolves

+ Natural selection occurs

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162801127.png" alt="image-20191231162801127" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 6. Growth In A Closed System

![image-20191231162827201](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162827201.png)

## Mathematics of Growth

**Generation (doubling) time**

+ time required for the population to double in size

+ varies depending on species of microorganism and environmental conditions

+ range is from 10 minutes for some bacteria to several days for some eukaryotic microorganisms

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231162953006.png" alt="image-20191231162953006" style="zoom:40%;" />

# 七、Measurement of microbial population size

## Direct Measurement

Direct cell counts

+ counting chambers

+ electronic counters: flow cytometry

+ on membrane filters

### 1. Counting Chambers 计数室

Easy, inexpensive, and quick

Useful for counting both eukaryotes and prokaryotes

Cannot distinguish living from dead microbial cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231163138584.png" alt="image-20191231163138584" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 2. Flow Cytometry 流式细胞（计量）术

![image-20191231163223104](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231163223104.png)

### 3. Membrane Filters

Cells filtered through special membrane that provides dark background for observing cells

Cells are stained with fluorescent dyes

Useful for counting bacteria

With certain dyes, can distinguish living from dead cells

## Viable counting (活菌计数): Alive or dead?

Whether or not a cell is alive or dead isn’t always clear cut in microbiology

+ Cells can exist in a variety of states between ‘fully viable’ and ‘actually dead’

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231163602546.png" alt="image-20191231163602546" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Viable Counting Methods

### 1. Spread and pour plate techniques

diluted sample of bacteria is spread over solid agar surface or mixed with agar and poured into Petri plate

after incubation the numbers of organisms are determined by counting the number of colonies multiplied by the dilution factor

results expressed as **colony forming units** (**CFU**)

### 2. Membrane filter technique

bacteria from aquatic samples are trapped on membranes 

membrane soaked in culture media

colonies grow on membrane 

colony count determines # of bacteria in sample

![image-20191231163703746](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231163703746.png)

![image-20191231163710308](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231163710308.png)

### 3. Turbidity – Turbidometric measures (light scattering)

quick, easy, and sensitive

Dilutions are made and added to suitable media

Turbidity determined to yield the **most probable** **number** (**MPN**)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231164116293.png" alt="image-20191231164116293" style="zoom:67%;" />

### 4. Dry weight

time consuming and not very sensitive

### 5. Quantity of a particular cell constituent

e.g., protein, DNA, ATP, or chlorophyll

useful if amount of substance in each cell is constant

# 八、The Continuous Culture of Microorganisms

Maintains cells in log phase at a constant biomass concentration for extended periods

Achieved using a continuous culture system

+ continual provision of nutrients

+ continual removal of wastes

## The Chemostat 恒化器

Rate of incoming medium = rate of removal of medium from vessel

An essential nutrient is in limiting quantities

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231164344744.png" alt="image-20191231164344744" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Dilution Rate and Microbial Growth

**Dilution rate** – rate atwhich medium flowsthrough vesselrelative to vessel size

note: cell densitymaintained at widerange of dilutionrates and chemostatoperates best at low dilution rate

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231164516455.png" alt="image-20191231164516455" style="zoom:50%;" />

## The Turbidostat 恒浊器

regulates the flow rate of media through vessel to maintain a predetermined turbidity or cell density

turbidostat operates best at high dilution rates

no limiting nutrient

dilution rate varies

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20191231164605680.png" alt="image-20191231164605680" style="zoom: 80%;" />
