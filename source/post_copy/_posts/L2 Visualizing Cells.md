# 一、Microscopy

**Light microscopy:** based on visible light rays and glass optics, most common are “transparency” microscopes where light goes through object (stained with specific dyes or not stained); there are also “reflection” (dissection scopes) and <u>fluorescent microscopes</u>

+  The numerical aperture affects the **light-gathering ability** of the lens and is related both to the **angle of the cone of light** that can enter it and to the refractive index of the medium the lens is operating in; 
+ The **refractive index** is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a particular transparent medium

**Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): **based of the flow of <u>electrons</u> through specially prepared (usually stained with osmium, Os, 锇), extremely thin object; allows to see the <u>internal organization</u> of cells and organelles

**Scanning electron microscopy (SEM): ** based on the electronic **reflection** from the surface covered with metals (typically, gold, Au，金) and provides an image of the surface of cells and organisms

### 1. Magnification and resolution

Light microscopy vs electron microscopy:

1. Resolution of light microscopy: 200 nm
2. Resolution of electron microscopy: 0.1 nm

![image-20200218140629382](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218140629382.png)

### 2. The nature of light

Light has a wave nature: light waves

All light waves transit optical systems with slightly different routes, thereby interfering with each other and cause optical diffraction effects

#### Limits of resolution

<u>Resolution is the minimum distance that two image can be clearly separated.</u>

## Light microscopy / Optical Microscopy

### 1. Different Examples

Most microscope has a mixed illumination

### 2. The principle of light microscopy

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143100616.png" alt="image-20200218143100616"  />

Magnification : up to 1000 fold

Eye piece: up to 10X

Objective: up to 100X

#### The development of chemical stain

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143128658.png" alt="image-20200218143128658" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### bright-field *vs* dark-field microscopy

##### (1) Bright field

Cells appear dark, <u>background appears bright</u> 

light passes through a cell to form image directly

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143202114.png" alt="image-20200218143202114" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### (2) Dark field

Cells appear bright, background appears dark 

Light illuminates the specimen <u>from the side</u>; only scattered light enters the lenses（光线从侧面照射标本;只有散射的光进入镜头）

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143219302.png" alt="image-20200218143219302" style="zoom:67%;" />

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143448147.png" alt="image-20200218143448147" style="zoom: 150%;" />

<u>Dark field is especially useful for finding cells in suspension</u>

### 3. Phase Contrast Microscope

#### Phase differences results in difference in brightness

When light passes through a living cell, the phase of the light wave is changed according to the cell’s **refractive index**: a relatively thick or dense part of the cell, such as a nucleus, slows the light passing through it

The **phase-contrast microscope** and, in a more complex way, the **differential-interference-contrast microscope** <u>increase these phase differences</u> so that the waves are more nearly out of phase, producing amplitude differences when the sets of waves recombine, thereby creating an image of the cell’s structure. 

Problem: live cells are usually colorless and translucent…

+ Solution : exploitation of <u>interference effects</u> of the light waves 
  
  + E.g. Phase contrast & Differential-interference –contrast, DIC
  
  + DIC 利用了光的相位差的效应，使得整个图像sharper

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218143654199.png" alt="image-20200218143654199" style="zoom:67%;" />

细胞表面不同部位的厚度不同，因此显示出的明暗关系不同

#### Components of a phase contrast microscope

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144049838.png" alt="image-20200218144049838" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### the Principle

> 利用物体不同结构成分之间的折射率和厚度的差别，把通过物体不同部分的[光程差](https://baike.baidu.com/item/光程差)转变为振幅（[光强度](https://baike.baidu.com/item/光强度)）的差别，经过带有环状光阑的聚光镜和带有相位片的相差物镜实现观测的显微镜。主要用于观察活细胞或不染色的组织切片，有时也可用于观察缺少反差的染色样品。

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144146184.png" alt="image-20200218144146184" style="zoom:67%;" />

### 4. Differential-Interference Contrast (DIC)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144217602.png" alt="image-20200218144217602" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Advantages of DIC – high contrast and plasticity

1. Analyze the optical path length gradients (the rate of change for refractive light). 
2. No annular diaphragm and phase plate needed 
3. Produce shadow-cast image.
4. Elimination of halo artifacts 
5. Excellent images with relatively <u>thick</u> specimens

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144343061.png" alt="image-20200218144343061" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Phase-contrast**, **differential-interference-contrast**, and **dark-field microscopy** make it possible to <u>watch the movements</u> involved in such processes as mitosis and cell migration

###  5. Fluorescence Microscope

#### What is fluorescence?

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144755388.png" alt="image-20200218144755388" style="zoom:80%;" />

```
Remember the Quantum Yield
```

#### Fluorescence Spectra 荧光光谱

A fluorophore absorbs a photon to be excited

It is not stable and undergoes <u>conformational</u> change to emit a photon

After it emits, it goes back to the ground state.

The cycle can be repeated. 

The energy of excitation light is higher than the energy of emission light，因此激发光的波长更短。

Lower energy = longer wavelength 

**Stokes shift (斯托克斯位移)**: <u>the difference between excitation energy and the emission energy for a given fluorophore</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218144911794.png" alt="image-20200218144911794" style="zoom:80%;" />

```
488 means at 488 nm is the Excitation Maximum
```

#### Optical system of a fluorescence microscope

1. **first barrier filter**: lets through only blue light with a wavelength between 450 and 490 nm （选择Excitation Light）
2. **beam-splitting mirror**: reflects light below 510 nm but transmits light above 510 nm（选择特定的光通过，比如反射Excitation，通过Emission）
3. **second barrier filter**: cuts out unwanted fluorescent signals, passing the specific green fluorescein emission between 520 and 560 nm

##### (1) Filter cube and nomenclature

![image-20200218145827458](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218145827458.png)

1. Arc Lamps 弧光灯
   + Hg and Xe
   + Metal Halide（卤化物）

2. LEDs

3. Lasers (Sharp wavelength)
   + Generally only for collimated illumination (Confocal, TIRF)

#### Fluorescence probes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218150236724.png" alt="image-20200218150236724" style="zoom:80%;" />

The **fluorescent dyes** used for staining cells are visualized with a **fluorescence  microscope**

##### (1) What sort of molecules are fluorescent?

**Organic fluorophores**

1. Intrinsic fluorophores (source of auto fluorescence)
2. Dyes： FITC, TRITC, etc..
3. Biological fluorophores - Fluorescent proteins: GFP, Phycoerythrin (PE)
   + Two fluorescent dyes that have been commonly used for this purpose are **fluorescein**（荧光素）, which emits  an intense <u>green fluorescence</u> when excited with **blue light**, and **rhodamine**, which  emits <u>deep red fluorescence</u> when excited with <u>green–yellow light</u>

**Inorganic fluorophores**

1. Quantum dots

##### (2) Synthetic fluorescence molecules

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218151433145.png" alt="image-20200218151433145" style="zoom:67%;" />

Protein labeling: couple to amino- or sulfhydryl groups (used to label the protein cell)

Direct and indirect (immuno-) fluorescence

```
Bind to: 
free cysteines (--SH) (often only one or a few in proteins)
free lysines (--NH2) (many per protein)
```

###### Quantum dots

“Artificial atoms” composed of small semiconductior nanocrystals (“人工原子”由小半导体或纳米晶体组成)

+ Tiny crystals of semiconductor material, called  nanoparticles, or **quantum dots**, can be excited to fluoresce by a broad spectrum  of blue light. Their emitted light has a color that <u>depends on the exact size of the  nanocrystal</u>, between <u>2 and 10 nm in diameter</u>, and additionally the fluorescence  fades only slowly with time

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218152614266.png" alt="image-20200218152614266" style="zoom:80%;" />

Pros

1. (<u>Stable</u>) Little to no photobleaching 
2. Very <u>bright</u>
3. Narrow emission spectra  (can be precisely fine-tuned)
4. Can use single excitation wavelength for multiple dyes

Cons

1. <u>Large</u> compared to small molecule dyes
2. Problems with non-specific binding

###### Quantum dots Spectrum

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218152739976.png" alt="image-20200218152739976" style="zoom:67%;" />

###### Fluorescent labeling

**Direct labeling** (& microinjection) of target molecules

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218152927143.png" alt="image-20200218152927143" style="zoom:80%;" />

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218152953080.png" alt="image-20200218152953080" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Parameters of fluorescence molecules

2. Extinction coefficient ε
   + ∝ absorption cross section
   + ε ≈ *50,000–100,000* M^-1^cm^-1^
3. Fluorescence quantum yield $Q_{f}$
   + Q~f~ = # Photons emitted / # photons absorbed
   + Q~f~ ≈ 25–90% (The higher the better)
4. Brightness ∝ ε $Q_{f}$

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218150847637.png" alt="image-20200218150847637" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### The enemy of fluorescence molecules: Photobleaching (光漂白；光褪色)

![image-20200218151156032](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218151156032.png)

Decrease in emission intensity after exposure

Exciting a molecule once has a probability Q~b~ of killing it

Each molecule will emit only a finite number of photons

#### Antibody-based immunofluorescence (IF)

IF: <u>specific</u> detection rather than simple neutral observation…

Direct immunofluorescence: 

+ primary antibody-conjugated fluorescence

Indirect immunofluorescence:

+ secondary antibody-conjugated fluorescence 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218153129541.png" alt="image-20200218153129541" style="zoom:80%;" />

<u>Antibody binding usually not work in living cells.</u>

##### (1) Immunofluorescence (IF) procedure

![image-20200218153606675](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218153606675.png)

+ Specimen preparation

  1. Step 1： cell fixation

     + 2-4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, acetone/methanol(1:1), 10% formalin or 10% methanol

  2. Step 2: permeabilize with detergent
     + 0.3% Triton-X-100
  3. Step 3: incubate with primary antibody
  4. Step 4: incubate with secondary antibody (conjugated-fluorescence)

###### Co-localization of protein of your interest with IF 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218153625401.png" alt="image-20200218153625401" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Metabolite imaging

##### (1) Microelectrode

This technique is used to measure the **intracellular concentrations** of common inorganic ions, such as H+, Na+, K+, Cl–, and Ca2+

these microelectrodes are not  ideally suited to record the **rapid** and **transient** changes in the concentration

Such changes can be analyzed with **ion-sensitive indicators**, whose <u>light emission</u> reflects the <u>local concentration</u> of the ion

##### (2) Protein

Aequorin, a luminescent protein 

that glows blue in the presence of Ca2+

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218153901958.png" alt="image-20200218153901958" style="zoom:80%;" />

Fura-2 can sense free Ca2+ ions in cells

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218153916588.png" alt="image-20200218153916588" style="zoom:50%;" />

```
Red: higher Ca2+
Blue: lower Ca2+
```

Many spectral variants of GFP are available… All variants result from point mutations in the “original GFP” sequence

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218154712814.png" alt="image-20200218154712814" style="zoom:50%;" />

Some Techniques:

1. Photo-activated GFP 

   <img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218154753776.png" alt="image-20200218154753776" style="zoom:70%;" />

Activate a target molecule by photoactivation, <u>as time goes, the fluorescence signal changes</u>. 

It can be used to monitor dynamic processes like protein trafficking, turnover, degradation, diffusion, etc. 

#### Confocal microscopy

A kind of **fluorescence** microscopy

+ The **confocal microscope** achieves a result similar to that of deconvolution, but does so by <u>manipulating the light before it is measured</u>

![image-20200218155140206](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218155140206.png)

The of focus light is excluded from detection! （对焦光被排除在检测之外）

More accurately detection of protein localization in a <u>3-D location.</u> 

Use <u>laser beam</u> as light source provide <u>better resolution.</u> 

+ To build up a **two-dimensional image**, data from  each point in the plane of focus are <u>collected sequentially</u> by <u>scanning across</u> the  field from left to right in a regular pattern of pixels and are displayed on a computer screen.
+ The confocal microscope has been used to resolve the structure of numerous  complex **three-dimensional objects**

**Confocal microscopes** tend to be better for **thicker specimens** with high levels of out-of-focus light.

---

The **cooled CCD** or **CMOS** cameras used for **deconvolution systems** are extremely efficient at  collecting small amounts of light, and they can be used to make **detailed three-dimensional images** from specimens that are too <u>weakly stained</u> or too <u>easily damaged</u> by the bright light used for confocal microscopy

Both methods, however, have another drawback; <u>neither is good at coping  with very thick specimens</u>

**Deconvolution methods** quickly become ineffective  any deeper than about **40 μm** into a specimen, while confocal microscopes can  only obtain images up to a depth of about **150 μm**

##### (1) Laser scanning confocal microscope 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218155201543.png" alt="image-20200218155201543" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Pros**: <u>better resolution</u> (Scanning sample point by point)

**Cons**: Illumination on specimen for <u>longer time</u>, sometime cause bleaching for fluorescence signal (<u>Easily bleached</u>)

#### Photobleaching Related Techniques

![image-20200219220904773](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219220904773.png)

Loss of fluorescence due to photon-induced chemical damage and covalent modification as a result of <u>interaction with other molecules</u>

##### (1) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)

FRAP is used to <u>detect movement of  molecules</u>.

Fluorescence is destroyed (bleached) in a selected region first. 

Then it is observed whether and how fast the fluorescence reappears. 

This is then due to arrival of new fluorescent molecules in that selected region.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221036592.png" alt="image-20200219221036592" style="zoom:67%;" />

Detect molecular movement

+ This technique is usually carried out with a **confocal microscope** and, like photoactivation, can deliver valuable quantitative data about a **protein’s kinetic** parameters, such as **diffusion coefficients**, **active transport rates**, or **binding and dissociation rates** from other proteins

##### (2) Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)

FLIP is also used to <u>detect movement of molecules.</u>

Fluorescence is destroyed (bleached) in a selected region continuously by a a laser beam. 

Then it is observed whether and how fast the total fluorescence disappears in the cell. 

This is then due to arrival of fluorescent molecules in other areas of cell to the selected region, which would be bleached.

Detect molecular movement

##### (3) Fröster-resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy

Rules for choosing the two fluorophores:

Emission spectrum of one must overlap with the excitation spectrum of the other. 

+ The **emission spectrum**  of one fluorochrome, the **donor**, overlaps with the **absorption spectrum** of the  other, the acceptor.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221304897.png" alt="image-20200219221304897" style="zoom:80%;" />

<u>Energy transferred from donor to acceptor</u>, useful to study <u>protein-protein interaction in cell.</u>

FRET occurs only in close distance (<10 nm). 

The FRET can be measured by quantifying the <u>reduction of the donor fluorescence</u> in the presence of the acceptor.

##### (4) Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)

What is fluorescence lifetime? 

Use fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) to detect FRET between GFP-Sensor (donor) and RFP-Ligand (acceptor).

##### (5) Total internal reflection (TIRF)

Single Molecules Can Be Visualized by Total Internal Reflection  Fluorescence Microscopy

In a **TIRF microscope**, laser light shines onto the cover-slip surface <u>at the precise critical angle</u> at which total internal reflection occurs

![image-20200613180154306](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200613180154306.png)

Because of  total internal reflection, the light does not enter the sample, and the majority of  fluorescent molecules are not, therefore, illuminated

+ However, electromagnetic energy does extend, as an **evanescent field**, for a very short distance beyond the  surface of the cover slip and into the specimen, <u>allowing just those molecules in  the layer closest to the surface to become excited.</u> (Only excite in-focus molecules)

 the technique is restricted to a thin layer within only <u>100–200 nm</u> of the cell surface 

### 6. Other High-tech Microscopy -- Obtaining sharper images

#### Deconvolution microscopy 反卷积显微镜

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200218155037306.png" alt="image-20200218155037306" style="zoom:67%;" />

Use computer-based algorithms to remove out of focus fight

+ The **computational approach** is often called *image deconvolution*

1.  For deconvolution, we first obtain a series of (blurred) images, usually with a cooled **CCD camera** or more recently a **CMOS camera**, focusing the microscope in turn on a  series of focal planes - in effect, a (blurred) three-dimensional image
2. Digital processing of the stack of digital images then removes as much of the blur as possible

### 7. Super-resolution Fluorescence microscopy

Goal: obtain sub-100 nm resolution

Two methods:

1. Spatially patterned excitation STED, SIM
2. Localization methods STORM, PALM, FPALM

#### Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)

+ Resolution is about <u>100nm</u>

Take use of the Moiré Pattern (莫尔条纹)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219222042453.png" alt="image-20200219222042453" style="zoom:80%;" />

SIM is a **fluorescence imaging method** with a resolution of about 100 nm, or twice the resolution of conventional bright-field and confocal microscopy

SIM overcomes the diffraction limit by using a **grated or structured pattern** of light to illuminate the sample. 

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219222101204.png" alt="image-20200219222101204" style="zoom:80%;" />

+ Illumination by a grid means that the parts of the sample in the dark stripes of the grid are not illuminated and therefore not imaged, so the imaging is <u>repeated several times</u> (usually three) after translating the grid through a fraction of the grid spacing between each image.

+ The whole process is repeated with the grid pattern rotated through a series of angles to obtain an equivalent enhancement in all directions. Finally, <u>mathematically combining</u> all these separate images by computer creates an enhanced super-resolution image. 

SIM is versatile because it can be used with <u>any fluorescent dye</u> or protein, and combining 

SIM images captured at consecutive focal planes can create three-dimensional data sets

---

The **point spread function** is the distribution of light intensity within  the three-dimensional, blurred image that is formed when a **single point source** of light is brought to a focus with a lens.

#### Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED)

+ Resolution is about <u>20 nm</u>

The fluorescent probes used must be in a special class that is photoswitchable: their emission can be reversibly switched on and off with lights of <u>different wavelengths</u>.

As the specimen is scanned with this arrangement of lasers, fluorescent molecules are <u>switched on and off</u>, and the small point spread function at each location is recorded. 

The diffraction limit is breached because the technique ensures that similar but very closely spaced molecules are in one of two different states, either fluorescing or dark. This approach is called *STED* (*stimulated emision depletion microscopy)*

#### The principle of PALM/STORM

Every time only active some of the molecules to avoid the overlapping light (Separating over time). The focus on the location but not the resolution.

+ Arrange for only a very few, clearly separated molecules to actively fluoresce at any one moment. The exact position of each of these can then be computed, before subsequent sets of molecules are examined.
+ In practice, this can be achieved by using **lasers** to sequentially switch on a <u>sparse （稀疏的） subset of fluorescent molecules</u> in a specimen containing photoactivatable or photo-switchable fluorescent labels
+ Each molecule emits a few thousand photons in response to the excitation before switching off, and the switching process can be <u>repeated hundreds or even thousands of times</u>, allowing the exact coordinates of a very large set of single molecules to be determined.
+ The full set can be <u>combined and digitally displayed</u> as an image in which the computed location of each individual molecule is exactly marked.

This class of methods has been variously termed *photoactivated localization microscopy* (*PALM*) or *stochastic optical* 

*reconstruction microscopy* (*STORM*).

Localizing is more precise than the resolution

##### (1) Further Introduction to Photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM)

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219222844674.png" alt="image-20200219222844674" style="zoom:80%;" />

Eric Betzig et al Imaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution *Science* 313, 1642 (2006).

+ Express protein of interest tagged with a photo-activatable fluorescent protein in cell
+ Stochastically photo-activate a low density of molecules per frame and localize using Gaussian function

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219222906364.png" alt="image-20200219222906364" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### (2) Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM)

![image-20200219223203296](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219223203296.png)

##### (3) Comparisions between STED and STORM/PALM

In STED, the locations of the molecules are <u>determined by using optical methods</u> to define exactly where their fluorescence will be on or off

In PALM and STORM, individual fluorescent molecules are switched on and off <u>at random</u> over a period of time, allowing their positions to be **accurately determined.** 

---

All these methods are now being extended to incorporate **multicolor  imaging**, three-dimensional imaging (Figure 9–39), and **live-cell imaging** in real  time.

### 8. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

In an **AFM** device,  an extremely small and sharply pointed **tip**, often of **silicon** or **silicon nitride**, is  made using **nanofabrication methods**

The tip of the AFM probe is attached to a <u>springy cantilever arm</u> mounted  on a highly precise positioning system that allows it to be moved over very small  distances

AFM device is  able to collect information about a variety of forces that it encounters—including  **electrostatic, van der Waals, and mechanical forces**

+ revealing any objects such as proteins or other molecules  that might be present on the otherwise flat surface

AFM can also be used to <u>pick up  and move single molecules</u> that adsorb strongly to the tip.

+ the mechanical properties of individual protein molecules can be measured in  detail. For example, AFM has been used to unfold a single protein molecule in  order to measure the energetics of domain folding

## Electron microscopy

Different concepts for different purposes

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221509063.png" alt="image-20200219221509063" style="zoom:67%;" />

TEM: Used to study detailed intracellular organization

SEM: Study the surface of the sample

problems of specimen preparation, contrast, and radiation damage have generally limited the normal effective resolution for biological  objects to 1 nm (10 Å).

### 1. Principle & features

Electrons penetrate the specimen 

Produce high resolution images

Observed subcellular organelles, virus structure, etc.

More expensive (no-not true anymore)

Special preparation of the sample required 

![image-20200219221548160](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221548160.png)

+ Some of the electrons passing through the specimen are scattered by  structures stained with the electron-dense material; the remainder are focused  to form an image
+ Because the scattered electrons are lost  from the beam, the dense regions of the specimen show up in the image as areas  of reduced electron flux, which look dark.

### 2. Sample Preparation

#### Chemical Fixation and Sectioning 

1. first with **glutaraldehyde** (戊二醛), which <u>covalently cross-links</u> protein molecules to their neighbors
2. then with **osmium tetroxide** (四氧化锇), which binds to and stabilizes lipid bilayers as well as  proteins
3. Because electrons have very limited penetrating power,  the fixed tissues normally have to be **cut into extremely thin sections** (25–100 nm thick, about 1/200 the thickness of a single cell) before they are viewed
   1. This is  achieved by **dehydrating the specimen**, permeating it with a **monomeric resin** (单体树脂)  that <u>polymerizes to form a solid block of plastics</u>
   2. then cutting the block with a fine  glass or **diamond knife** on a **special microtome**.

#### Rapid Freezing Fixation

Electron microscopy samples are always chemically fixed before dehydration, resin-embedding, and sectioning.

They can also be fixed by rapid freezing, in a way that precludes **ice-crystal formation**, to ensure minimal damage to the original call structures.

This can be done by:

+  High-pressure cooling
+  Plunging into liquid nitrogen
+ Spraying with a jet of liquid propane
+ Contact with a copper block cooled by liquid helium

#### Heavy Metal Impregnation

Biological tissues are composed mainly of atoms of very **low atomic number** (primarily carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). 

+ To make them visible, tissues  are usually impregnated (before or after sectioning) with the **salts** of **heavy metals**  such as **uranium**, **lead**, and **osmium**

### 3. Ultrastructural analysis (TEM)

Always: <u>Dehydrated</u> specimen (no live cell imaging possible).

Sample has to be dehydrated and ultra thin sliced

+ 50-100 nm thick (penetrating power for electron is very weak) 

Sample is usually rapidly frozen to preserve its original state and to prevent formation of hexagonal ice crystals by <u>high-pressure freezing (HPF)</u>. 

<u>Sometimes, chemical fixation with **Glutaraldehyde (to crosslink proteins) and Osmium tetroxide (to stabilize lipid membranes)**</u> 

Contrast can be enhanced by using **heavy metals** (uranyl-acetate and lead-citrate)

Dehydration of the sample 

<u>Resin（树脂、松香）-embedding</u>

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221704318.png" alt="image-20200219221704318" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Fixatives for specimen preparation EM are extremely dangerous

All chemicals that are used to fix the cells or to enhance the contrast are very toxic!

ALWAYS: Carefully check all instructions and procedures

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221730698.png" alt="image-20200219221730698" style="zoom:67%;" />

### 4. Immunogold electron microscopy (IEM)

> Specific Macromolecules Can Be Localized by **Immunogold  Electron Microscopy**

The usual procedure is to incubate a thin section first with a **specific primary antibody**, and then  with a **secondary antibody** to which a **colloidal gold particle has been attached.**

A complication for immunogold labeling is that the antibodies and colloidal  gold particles do not penetrate into the resin used for embedding; therefore, they  detect antigens only at <u>the surface of the section</u>

+ One solution is to label the specimen  before embedding it in plastic, when cells and tissues are still fully accessible to  labeling reagents.

<img src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221808000.png" alt="image-20200219221808000" style="zoom:80%;" />

Immunodetection of proteins via antibodies

+ Specific protein binds with its primary antibody 
+ Gold particle-conjugated secondary antibody is incubated to label the primary antibody with a gold particle.
+ Gold is <u>electron-dense</u> and appears as <u>black dot</u>

### 5. Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM)

A **scanning electron microscope (SEM)** directly produces an image of the  **three-dimensional structure** of the <u>surface of a specimen</u>

#### Principle & features

Produces <u>3-D structure</u> for the surface of a specimen.

+ Only surface features can be examined,  however, and in most forms of SEM, the resolution attainable is not very high  (about 10 nm, with an effective magnification of up to 20,000 times). As a result,  the technique is usually used to study whole cells and tissues rather than subcellular organelles

<u>Uses electrons that are scattered or emitted from the specimen’s surface.</u>

+ Lower resolution ~ 10 nm
+ Usually whole cells or tissues, not subcellular organelles. 

![image-20200219221946108](https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Cell%20Biology/image-20200219221946108.png)



### 6. electron-microscope (EM) tomography

Because of the large depth of field of electron microscopes, all the parts of the  three-dimensional specimen are in focus

The resulting image is a projection  (a superimposition of layers) of the structure along the viewing direction

+ The lost  information in the third dimension can be recovered if we have views of the same  specimen <u>from many different directions.</u>

In electron-microscope (EM) tomography, we can arrive at a three-dimensional  reconstruction, in a chosen standard orientation, by combining different views  of a single object.

### 7. Cryoelectron Microscopy

An alternative  that allows us to visualize directly at high resolution even the interior features  of three-dimensional structures such as viruses and organelles is cryoelectron  microscopy, in which **rapid freezing** to form **vitreous ice** is again the key

+ A special sample holder keeps this hydrated specimen at –160°C in the vacuum of the microscope, where it can be viewed directly  without fixation, staining, or dryings

**hydrated cryoelectron  microscopy** produces an image from the macromolecular structure itself. However, the **contrast in this image is very low,** and to extract the maximum amount  of structural information, special **image-processing techniques** must be used

### 8. EM VS. X-Ray Crystallography

1. First, it does not  absolutely require crystalline specimens. 
2. Second, it can <u>deal with extremely large  complexes</u>—structures that may be too large or too variable to crystallize satisfactorily. 
3. Third, it allows the <u>rapid analysis</u> of <u>different conformations</u> of protein  complexes.

# 二、Processing and Digital Techniques

## Image Processing

### 1. Camera

image processing, have had a major impact on light microscopy

These cameras detect light by means of **charge-coupled devices (CCDs)**, or high sensitivity **complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors**, similar to those found in digital cameras

Such image sensors are 10 times more sensitive  than the human eye and can detect 100 times more intensity levels.

### 2. Single-Particle Reconstruction

The solution is to obtain images of many identical molecules—perhaps tens  of thousands of individual images—and combine them to produce an averaged  image, revealing structural details that are hidden by the noise in the original  images. 

This procedure is called **single-particle reconstruction**

## Fixation and Section Before Microscopy

Common fixatives include **glutaraldehyde**, which forms <u>covalent bonds with  the free amino groups</u> of proteins, <u>cross-linking them</u> so they are stabilized and  locked into position.

Because tissues are generally soft and fragile, even after fixation, they need to be either **frozen** or **embedded** in a **supporting medium** before being sectioned.  The usual embedding media are **waxes** or **resins**.

The dye **hematoxylin**, for example, has an affinity for <u>negatively charged molecules</u> and therefore  reveals the distribution of DNA, RNA, and acidic proteins in a cell

## Staining

If they are **shadowed** with a heavy metal to provide contrast, isolated macromolecules such as DNA or large proteins can be visualized readily in the electron  microscope, but **negative staining** allows finer detail to be seen

**Shadowing** and **negative staining** can provide <u>high-contrast surface views</u> of  small macromolecular assemblies, but the size of the smallest metal particles in  the shadow or stain used limits the resolution of both techniques

# 三、Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
